# Translator

This module is responsible for translating text.
It uses IBM Watson Translator as translating service.

## API
### translate(text)
This method takes one parameter as input: string containing text to translate.
It returns a dictionary of following structure:
```
    'translation_type': 'auto',
    'original_text': input_text,
    'translated_text': output_text,
    'language': language_name
```
If an error occurs there is also a key named `message` containing description of this error.

## Setting up IBM Watson Translator
This module requires Translator service running on IBM Cloud.
Instructions on how to setup an instance of this service can be found in IBM Cloud documentation:
***https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/language-translator?topic=language-translator-gettingstarted***

It is also required to supply credentials for the service, as described in ***https://pypi.org/project/ibm-watson/#authentication***
The "Credential file" method should be used.

## Other possible translators
There are some other solutions for translating text. They differ between each other in usage, price and number of 
characters that can be translated for free each month. Here are links to some of them:
