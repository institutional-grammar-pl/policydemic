```

Backend and Frontend use yarn package manager. Install dependencies with:
```
yarn install
```
To install additional packages run `yarn add package` or `yarn add package --dev`.

### RabbitMQ
The easiest setup for RabbitMQ is to run it in docker:
```
docker run -d -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq
```
Otherwise refer to RabbitMQ documentation for installing and configuring an instance

### Staring workers
Starting regular queue worker:
```
celery -A scheduler worker -l info
```
Starting beat service for periodic tasks:
```
celery -A scheduler beat
```
Test your queues by running modifing and running `python cli.py`.

## Packages

- backend - node.js+koa server
- frontend - create-react-app frontend SPA
- scheduler - celery configuration and scheduling tasks
- crawler - website crawling code and celery task definitions (LAD, SSD)
- nlpengine - processing of crawled files and input to DB
- translator - translating db records and documents

## Deployment
There are 2 options to start the services:

* pure Docker - run each container individually.
