<p>This policy tracker summarizes the key economic responses governments
 are taking to limit the human and economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. The tracker includes 196 economies. Last updated on September 
25, 2020.</p>
<p class="small"><span style="font-size: 13px;">
NOTE: The tracker focuses on discretionary actions and might not fully 
reflect the policies taken by countries in response to COVID-19, such as
  automatic insurance mechanisms and existing social safety nets which 
differ across countries in their breadth and scope. The information 
included is not meant for comparison across members as responses vary 
depending on the nature of the shock and country-specific circumstances.
 Adding up the different measures—tax and spending, loans and

<h3>Afghanistan, Islamic Republic of</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Afghanistan reported its first confirmed <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6" target="_blank">COVID-19 case</a>
 on February 24, 2020. &nbsp;As the infection spread in March, the 
government progressively tightened containment measures, including 
introducing screening at ports of entry, quarantine for infected people,
 and closure of public places for gathering. On March 28, it imposed 
countrywide  lockdown, which was subsequently extended twice.</p>
<p>The pandemic and containment measures stifled domestic activity and 
disrupted trade and transportation. Border closures and panic-buying led
 to a temporary spike in prices of some foodstuffs in April, which has 
abated with the re-opening of borders in early June. Income and job 
losses, in the formal and informal sectors, and higher prices have 
pushed thousands of Afghan families into poverty and have threatened to 
reverse social development gains of the past decade. Oxfam estimates 
that the number of people on brink of famine in Afghanistan has risen to
 3.5 million in May from 2.5 million in September last year. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy: </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The government has progressively eased the lockdown in over the 
summer, with most containment restrictions removed by end-August.</li>
    <li>The government announced new working hours for government and 
non-government organizations, alternating between even and odd weekdays,
 from 7 am until 1 pm. On July 12, working hours of government 
organizations were extended from 8 am to 4 pm, with employees 
alternating between even and odd workdays.</li>
    <li>On July 22, wedding halls were allowed to open. Universities and schools reopened on August 5 and 12.</li>
    <li>On May 17, Pakistan re-opened its Torkham and Chaman borders 
points with Afghanistan, followed by a restoration of bilateral trade 
and transit at all border crossings to pre-Covid-19 status on July 13. 
On July 15, trade with India through Wagah border post in Pakistan 
resumed. At end-June, the authorities announced the resumption of 
domestic and international flights and exports to Europe via the air 
corridors.</li>
    <li>FEWS Net reports that the May easing of containment led to 
increasing labor availability in urban areas and, in combination with 
assistance and Zakat, has allowed some improvement in consumption. 
Still, many Afghans remain in a crisis phase of food insecurity.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<p>The government initially allocated Af 8 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) 
from contingency funds for emergency pandemic response, of which Af 1.9 
billion (0.1 percent of GDP) for urgent health needs, such as 
establishing testing labs, including at border crossings; setting up 
special wards to boost hospitalization and care capacity; and procuring 
critical medical supplies.
</p>
<p>On April 29, the government started providing free bread to the poor 
in Kabul, later extended to other cities. The program was ended in late 
June. In May, the government waived electricity bills of less than Af 
1,000 (US$13) for a family residence in Kabul for two months and paid 
utility bills of the past two months for 50 percent of households in 
Kabul. The decision benefited more than 1.5 million Kabul residents. 
Recognizing the liquidity constraints of many taxpayers, the government 
extended the tax filing deadline for the first quarter by 45 days. No 
further extensions have been provided. </p>
<p>The authorities are preparing a mid-year budget revision, which is 
expected to include the following COVID-19 related spending, including 
those approved in the July budget amendment:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Health package amounting to Af 6.2 billion, including for building hospitals;</li>
    <li>Social package, including the now concluded bread distribution 
program of Af 2.8 billion and the World Bank-supported social 
distribution program in the amount of Af 20.8 billion (see below);</li>
    <li>Wheat purchase program (Af 1.7 billion); </li>
    <li>Transfers to provinces to finance Covid-19 response (Af 2.3 billion);</li>
    <li>Package to support agriculture (Af 5.9 billion) and short-term jobs (Af 1.0 billion).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In 2020, the authorities envisage up to 2.9 percent of GDP for 
pandemic-related spending, with about 15 percent directed to health.</p>
<p>With the support of the World Bank grant, the authorities are rolling
 out a relief package, amounting to 1.6 percent of GDP, to Afghan 
households with incomes of US$2 per day or lower (twice the national 
poverty line). As about 90 percent of all households fall below that 
threshold, the program is near universal. Households in rural areas will
 receive an equivalent of US$50 in essential food staples and hygiene 
products, while those in urban areas a combination of cash and in-kind 
equivalent to US$100, in two tranches. </p>
<h5>Monetary and Macro-financial</h5>
<p>There have been no liquidity pressures in part thanks to Da 
Afghanistan Bank (DAB)’s actions to maintain confidence in the Afghani 
and among depositors. The authorities increased the frequency of 
Financial Stability Committee meetings, enhanced the monitoring of early
 signs of liquidity stress, and reviewed banks’ business continuity 
plans. DAB postponed the IFRS-9 implementation to June 2021 and froze 
loan classifications at the pre-pandemic cutoff of end-February. It also
 suspended administrative penalties and fees, with no retrospective 
applications for breaches/noncompliance. </p>
<p>DAB phased out emergency pandemic measures in July. It ended the 
freeze on loan classifications and recommenced the enforcement of all 
prudential requirements in August with flexible application of penalties
 and prudential triggers in recognition of persisting risks. The 
emergency measures for the nonbank sector were allowed to expire at 
end-July.</p>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<p>DAB remains focused on achieving price stability in the context of a 
flexible exchange rate regime. With domestic demand subdued the Afghani 
has remained broadly stable against the US$. DAB has engaged 
money-service providers, who play a systemic role in financial 
intermediation, to ensure uninterrupted services.</p>

<h3>Albania</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 9, 2020. Due to its proximity and close links to 
Italy, Albania adopted some of the toughest lockdown measures in Europe.
 The parliament adopted on April 18 amendments to the penal code, 
legislating harsh punishments for those breeching the lockdown or 
quarantine. The state of natural catastrophe which enabled the 
government to use extended powers for its three months duration ended on
 June 23.</p>
<p>In a sign of solidarity with its neighbor and main trading partner, 
Albania sent teams of doctors&nbsp;and nurses&nbsp;to help fight against
 the COVID-19 pandemic in north Italy, one of the worst hit areas in the
 world.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reopening the economy. </strong>On June 1, Albania removed 
all domestic restrictions to movement and travel and re-opened its land 
borders after virtually shutting them since mid-March. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.infrastruktura.gov.al/rinis-puna-ne-linjat-e-transportit-detar-te-pasagjereve/" target="_blank">Maritime passenger transport</a>
 resumed on June 22 and airlines have resumed flights on a lighter 
schedule since mid-June. There are no quarantine requirements for 
incoming visitors and tourists. Due to an increased number of cases 
since restrictions were lifted, Albania is not included in the list of 
third countries with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reopen.europa.eu/en" target="_blank">which travel restrictions to the EU</a> were lifted on August 8.</p>
<p>Most businesses are open, including bars and restaurants for outside 
sitting. &nbsp;However, the reopening led to a spike in new infections, 
with the number of active cases and victims rising fast. Gradual 
reopening started since mid-April based on a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://shendetesia.gov.al/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Covid_Strategjia-e-rihapjes.pdf" target="_blank">strategy</a>
 prepared by the Ministry of Health, which factors in new number of 
cases, hospitalization and patients needing intensive care. The 
government wants to avoid a second lockdown and has called on citizens 
to abide to physical distancing measures. The use of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://new.shendetesia.gov.al/vendimi-i-qeverise-manastirliu-maskat-barrierat-mbrojtese-behen-te-detyrueshme-ne-cdo-ambient-te-mbyllur/" target="_blank">masks indoors became mandatory</a>
 on July 15. Large gatherings continue to be banned and cinemas, 
theaters, night clubs and swimming pools remain closed. Wedding parties 
are not allowed, and funerals are restricted to family members. Public 
transport was allowed to resume on June. Pre-university schools will 
re-open on September 14, with preparations being made to use a 
combination of shifts and on-line learning. Universities will start on 
November 1. &nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 10, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government has adopted two support packages for people and 
businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic of a combined size of Lek 
45 billion (2.8 percent of GDP) consisting of budget spending, sovereign
 guarantees and tax deferrals. The first package adopted on March 19 
through a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://financa.gov.al/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Akti-Normativ.pdf" target="_blank">normative act</a>&nbsp;had
 support measures of Lek 23bn (1.4 percent of GDP) through a combination
 of spending reallocations, spending increases and sovereign guarantees 
to support affected businesses. The key measures are: (i) additional 
funding for health sector in the amount of Lek 2.5 billion&nbsp; (ii) 
Lek 6.5bn for the support of small businesses/self-employed that are 
forced to close activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic by paying them 
minimum salaries (up to two in the case of family businesses with unpaid
 family members), doubling of the unemployment benefits and social 
assistance layouts. (iii) Lek 2bn of defense spending reallocated toward
 humanitarian relief for the most vulnerable, (iv) Lek 11bn (0.6 percent
 of GDP) sovereign guarantee fund for companies to access overdrafts in 
the banking system to pay wages for their employees for up to 3 months 
with an interest rate capped at 2.85 percent for a maturity of up to 2 
years. The government will bear the interest costs. The second package <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://qbz.gov.al/eli/akt-normativ/2020/04/15/15" target="_blank">adopted</a> on April 15<sup>t</sup>includes
 (i) Lek 7bn (0.4 percent of GDP) fund to pay for a one-off transfer of 
Lk40,000 to employees of small businesses affected by the pandemic not 
covered in the first package, employees of large businesses laid off due
 to the pandemic, and employees in the tourism sector; (ii) a sovereign 
guarantee of Lek 15 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) to provide loans for 
working capital for all private companies that were tax-compliant and 
solvent before the pandemic. The government will guarantee 60 percent of
 the loans, and interest are capped at 5 percent. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://financa.gov.al/raporte-per-covid-19/" target="_blank">As of September</a>
 3, more than 94 percent of the overall budgeted direct support measures
 had been paid out while the take up for the first guarantee scheme was 
59 percent and for the second scheme 42 percent. A third smaller support
 package was adopted on August 13, providing an additional minimum wage 
to public transport workers who resumed work one month later than the 
rest. The measure costing Lk135m is accommodated within the existing 
transport budget.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The government has also adopted tax deferral measures allowing 
all large companies (except banks, telecommunication, public enterprises
 and other essential businesses) to defer payment of profit tax for the 
second and third quarter of 2020 in 2021. Tourism, active processing and
 call centers can defer payments for the rest of 2020 to 2021. Small 
businesses with turnover below Lk14m will not pay profit tax for the 
remainder of 2021.</p>

    <p>To address the liquidity bottlenecks of companies and individuals, the Bank of Albania extended a temporary <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bankofalbania.org/Press/Press_Releases/Document_Title_26867_1.html">suspension of requirements for loan classifications and provisioning</a>
 to August 31, enabling clients to ask banks to defer loan installments 
without penalties. On May 28, the BoA also adopted regulations to allow 
banks to restructure loans within 2020 without additional provisioning 
or downgrades for borrowers’ status. Entry in force of more stringent 
classification and provisioning measures for reclassified loans was 
postponed by one year to 2022. Out of court restructuring for distressed
 borrowers under a special regulation will be possible for an additional
 year until 2022.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>On March 25, the Bank of Albania&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bankofalbania.org/Press/Press_Releases/Monetary_Policy_Decisions_25_3_2020.html">cut its key policy rate</a>-the

people requiring services in bank premises, the central bank also waived
 the commissions for transfers in local currency.</p>
    <p>On July 17, the Bank of Albania announced it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200717_1~f143ca1c56.en.html">had set up a €400 million repo line</a> with the ECB. The line will remain in place until June 2021, unless an extension is decided</p>

<h3>Algeria</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Algeria is being hit by two shocks—the 
spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in oil prices. Government 
policy is responding to both shocks. The first case of COVID-19 was 
reported on February 25, 2020. The authorities have been implementing 
containment measures since early February (e.g., cancelling flights, and
 imposing quarantines to repatriated Algerians). Confinement measures 
included closure of schools, universities, restaurants, and shops; 
cancellation of public and private events; shut down of transportation 
services (internal and external); putting on mandatory leave half of 
civil servants and private workers with full compensation. 
Demonstrations and religious activities were cancelled, a lockdown of 
affected areas was ordered and a curfew was put in place in several 
cities including Algiers.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The full lockdown of 
certain cities ended in early June, while the curfews, notably in 
Algiers, were relaxed. A gradual easing of the containment measured was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.tsa-algerie.com/alerte-coronavirus-lalgerie-entamera-son-deconfinement-le-7-juin/" target="_blank">announced</a>
 and started on June 7, mostly consisting in allowing certain stores to 
open, under social distancing rules such as wearing masks and limiting 
the number of people in the stores. Faced with a resurgence in the daily
 number of cases, new restrictions to mobility, retail activities and 
social events were announced in several provinces on June 29. The 
authorities continue to monitor and adapt the lockdown measures as 
needed (latest decision on August 8 here). International borders remain 
closed. As of early September, the daily number of cases has gone under 
300, compared to around 600 during the summer peak.</p>

    <p>A national socio-economic recovery plan was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.premier-ministre.gov.dz/fr/premier-ministre/activites/com-19-08-2020-fr2.html" target="_blank">discussed</a>
 at a conference on August 18 and 19. Among other things the plan aims 
to ensure food and pharmaceutical security, promote a favorable business
 climate, and foster high value added sectors and international trade 
and FDI. A supplementary finance law (SFL) was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mfdgi.gov.dz/images/pdf/lois_de_finances/LFC2020FR.pdf" target="_blank">enacted</a>
 on June 4. It includes provisions amounting to 70bn dinars to mitigate 
the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. For the health 
sector, this includes 3.7bn for medical supplies, 16.5bn for bonus 
payments to health workers, and 8.9bn for the health sector’s 
development. For the economic impact, the law includes 20bn for 
allowances to the unemployed because of COVID, and 11.5bn for transfers 
to poor households. Overall, in order to adjust to the new low oil price
 environment, the SFL plans for a reduction in current and capital 
spending by 5.7 percent (representing 2.2 percent of 2019 GDP) compared 
to the initial 2020 budget law. In response to the economic impact on 
household and enterprises of the lockdown measures, the authorities also
 announced that: (i) the declaration and payments of income taxes for 
individuals and enterprises have been&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mfdgi.gov.dz/index.php/8-contenu-en-francais/actualites/1625-test" target="_blank">postponed</a>, except for large enterprises; and (ii) contractual deadlines would be <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.premier-ministre.gov.dz/fr/premier-ministre/activites/com-15-04-2020-fr.html" target="_blank">relaxed</a> and penalties for companies that experience delays in completing public contracts would be suspended.</p>

<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first COVID-19 case was reported on 
March 21, 2020, while community transmission started on April 27. On 
September 8, authorities announced plans for a gradual removal of 
remaining restrictions, including the resumption of commercial flights 
(excluding tourism trips) by mid-September and school activities in 
October. Authorities extended the sanitary restrictions in Luanda until 
October 8; expanded testing activities to hospitals, informal markets, 
and public institutions; made the use of masks mandatory;. Home 
quarantine is now allowed for national and foreign citizens returning

    <p>The National Assembly approved revenue and expenditure measures 
to fight the COVID-19 outbreak and minimize its negative economic 
impact. About US$40 million on additional health care spending was 
announced and about US$80 million are being spent on 250 Cuban doctors 
who arrived in Angola to help. Tax exemptions on humanitarian aid and 
donations and some delays on filing taxes for selected imports were 
granted. On July 28, the National Assembly adopted a conservative

 requested to grant their clients a moratorium of 60 days for servicing 
debt. In April 3, the BNA increased the minimum allocation required from
 banks to extend credit to producers of priority products and instructed
 banks to provide credit in local currency to assist importers of 
essential goods. In May 7, the BNA reinstated its Permanent Overnight 
Liquidity Provision facility to provide liquidity support to banks (Kz

<h3>Argentina</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 3, 2020. The authorities have adopted sweeping 
measures to prevent a rapid growth in infections, involving a full 
closure of borders and a nation-wide quarantine, beginning on March 20. 
The pandemic and the containment measures have had a significant 
economic impact, with a GDP contraction of around 20 percent of GDP in 
the first half of 2020. Capital Flow Management Measures (CFMs) that 
were already in place since August 2019 have largely protected Argentina
 from the impact of capital outflows.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The government’s policy of
 moving from strict lockdown to a gradual reopening of the economy is 
contingent on the speed of contagion, defined as the length of time it 
takes for the number of reported cases to double. On May 8, with the 
doubling of contagions rising above 25 days, the government announced a 
gradual reopening aimed at raising regional mobilization from 50 to 75 
percent in all districts, except for the Buenos Aires metropolitan area.
 On May 23, restrictions in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area were 
tightened in response to an acceleration in infections and, in early 
June, the mandatory lockdown was extended to other selected large 
cities. Amidst a continued surge in infections, on June 26 restrictions 
on mobility were tightened further in the capital and the surrounding 
province. On July 17, the government announced a loosening of 
restrictions in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area and a phased 
reopening of activities. However, with infections continuing to rise, 
the mandatory lockdown has been extended, most recently until October 
11, and with tighter enforcement in some inland provinces.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Announced measures (totaling about 6.0 percent of GDP, 3.9 
percent in the budget and 2.1 percent off-budget, based on the 
authorities’ estimates) have focused on providing: (i) <strong><em>increased health spending</em></strong><em>,</em>
 including for improvements in virus diagnostics, purchases of hospital 
equipment and construction of clinics and hospitals; (ii) <strong><em>support for workers and vulnerable groups</em></strong>,
 including through increased transfers to poor families, social security
 benefits (especially to low-income beneficiaries), unemployment 
insurance benefits, and payments to minimum-wage workers; (iii) <strong><em>support for hard-hit sectors</em></strong>,
 including an exemption from social security contributions, grants to 
cover payroll costs; and subsidized loans for construction-related 
activities; (iv) <strong><em>demand support</em></strong>, including spending on public works; (v) <strong><em>forbearance</em></strong>, including continued provision of utility services for households in arrears; and (vi) <strong><em>credit guarantees</em> </strong>for
 bank lending to micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) for the 
production of foods and basic supplies. In addition, the authorities 
have adopted <strong><em>anti-price gouging policies</em></strong>, including price controls for food and medical supplies and <strong><em>ringfencing of essential supplies</em></strong>,
 including certain export restrictions on medical supplies and equipment
 and centralization of the sale of essential medical supplies.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Measures have been aimed at encouraging bank lending through (i) 
lower reserve requirements on bank lending to households and SMEs; (ii) 
regulations that limit banks’ holdings of central bank paper to provide 
space for SME lending; (iii) temporary easing of bank provisioning needs
 and of bank loan classification rules (i.e. extra 60 days to be 
classified as non-performing); and (iv) a stay on both bank account 
closures due to bounced checks and credit denial to companies with 
payroll tax arrears.</p>

<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>A broad set of CFMs have been in place since August 2019, aimed 
at restricting financial account transactions (limits on purchase of 
dollars, transfers abroad and debt service in foreign currency), and 
some current account transactions (surrender requirements on export 
proceeds, restrictions on imports of services, dividend payments abroad,
 and interest payments on foreign currency debt). CFMs helped limit 
outflows in the wake of the pandemic. The exchange rate has depreciated 
by over 21 percent vis-à-vis the US dollar since early March. </p>

<h3>Armenia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed case was reported on
 March 1, 2020.  Armenia is currently facing a steep increase in 
COVID-19 cases with a very high infection rate per capita. The 
government extended a national state of emergency to September 11, and 
imposed strict containment measures, including school closures, travel 
bans on foreign citizens from high risk countries, and imposed fines to 
those who violate isolation orders during the state of emergency. The 
government announced an assistance package with a headline amount of 
$300 million (2 percent of GDP) to mitigate the socio-economic issues 
related to the pandemic, although this includes a variety of direct 
spending, state-sponsored loans and increased investment.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Since May, the movement 
restrictions were removed, and containment measures were eased, allowing
 for resumption of public transport, retail businesses, and restaurants.
 In September, airspace was reopened, and the government lifted the 
state of emergency, and established quarantine in effect until Jan 11, 
2021, imposing fines for those not wearing masks in public, bans on 
large gathering, and 14-day self-isolation and testing for incomers. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The measures fall into three broad categories: (i) subsidized 2-3
 year loans to provide short-term support to affected businesses and 
SMEs; (ii) direct subsidies to SMEs and businesses to help maintain 
their employees; (iii) grants to entrepreneurs and firms; (iv) lump-sum 
transfers to the vulnerable including individuals who were unemployed 
after the COVID-19 outbreak, families with or expecting children, 
micro-businesses,  general population who needed help with utility 
bills, and temporary part-time employment. As of mid-August, the 
authorities have adopted 24 support packages and, together with bank 
supports, allocated around 144.5 billion AMD ($295m) to those.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) reduced the policy rate by 
another 25 bps to 4.25 percent on September 15. The interbank market has
 been active, and the central bank has easily met liquidity needs so far
 and provided a few FX swap operations to assure sufficient liquidity in
 dram and in FX. The CBA undertook few foreign exchange sales to limit 
excessive dram volatility around the beginning of April, although since 
then the dram has strengthened, and the CBA has been able buy some FX. 
The CBA has not used macroprudential policies actively, except asking 
banks to consider voluntary prudent loan restructuring and payment 
holiday period from March to June. The CBA’s authorities are supervising
 banks’ liquidity positions and will act swiftly if required to 
safeguard financial stability.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The exchange rate has been allowed to adjust flexibly and has 
appreciated to pre-pandemic level against the US$. No balance of payment

<h3>Aruba</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The number of reported new Coronavirus 
cases has resurged significantly since reopening borders on June 15. The
 total number of confirmed infections now stands at 3,721 with 25 deaths
 since March. The outbreak is affecting Aruba through two key 
channels—disruption to domestic activity from voluntary and mandatory 
social distancing and a sharp decline in tourism. The authorities have 
adopted containment measures, including a shelter-in place, a compulsory
 dusk-to-dawn curfew, travel restrictions, suspension of non-vital 
government work, closures of schools and non-essential business 
activities, and limits on social gatherings.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On April 30, the Aruban 
government announced a four-phase plan to gradually relax restrictions 
starting May 4, and as of June 27, all economic activities resumed.  On 
June 15, travels between the Dutch Kingdom Islands of Aruba, Bonaire and
 Curaçao resumed with the need of a medical test on arrival. 
International borders reopened to Europe, Canada, and the Caribbean, 
except the Dominican Republic and Haiti, on July 1st, and to the United 
States on July 10. The Aruban government requires travelers from 24 high
 risk states in the United States to upload negative Covid-19 test 
results online 72 hours prior to arrival, while travelers from the other
 26 states can choose to have a prepaid test taken upon arrival with a 
mandatory quarantine while awaiting test results. Travelers also need to
 be insured for medical expenses should they test positive during their 
stay. With open borders, the Aruba Department of Infrastructure and 
Tourism Authority have taken action in placing signs communicating 
hygiene, health, and environmental protocols. At the same time, due to 
the resurgence of new cases, the department of health announced on 
August 3rd a contingency plan to slow down the spread of local 
transmission, which includes the launch of a mobile app for locals to 
facilitate the process of testing, and most recently the establishment 
of a special helpline for Covid-19 patients in need of assistance. The 
authorities are also promoting Aruba as an alternative destination for 
foreigners to work remotely. As of September 9, bars, nightclubs and 
rum-shops remain close, social gatherings and home parties remain 
prohibited with the exception of funerals where a maximum of 25 people 
is allowed, and a curfew from 10PM to 5AM was reintroduced. In addition,
 masks are mandatory on all public spaces and locations, churches remain
 under the restrictive protocols, and visits and admissions to elderly 
care and nursing homes remain prohibited. Since September 10 a fine of 
1,000 florins (approximately US $560) applies to those who do not adhere
 to regulations. </p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On March 26, the parliament approved the amended 2020 budget, 
containing a higher spending related to the healthcare sector and three 
supporting programs: a relief package for employees who lose their jobs 
due to the virus outbreak; a package to support social security; and a 
package to support small and medium-sized enterprises, while the planned
 fiscal consolidation reforms for 2020 have been postponed. The 
authorities reduced government expenditures, including the wage bill and
 goods and services, to contain the anticipated large deficit in the 
budget, and introduce a 3-month payroll subsidy for businesses that have
 seen a drop of over 25% in their monthly revenues.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On March 17, the central bank of Aruba (CBA) lowered: the reserve
 requirement on commercial bank deposits from 12 to 11 percent; the 
minimum capital adequacy ratio from 16 to 14 percent; and the prudential
 liquidity ratio from 18 to 15 percent. Furthermore, the maximum allowed
 loan-to-deposit ratio was increased from 80 to 85 percent (see: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cbaruba.org/cba/readBlob.do?id=6307" target="_blank">https://www.cbaruba.org/cba/readBlob.do?id=6307</a>).
 Moreover, on May 5, the CBA further lowered reserve requirement to 7 
percent. On June 30, the CBA published the results of its yearly stress 
test on the commercial banking sector concluding that the existing ample
 capital and liquidity buffers provide banks with sufficient room to 
withstand significant external shocks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, 
provided that the recovery starts in the second half of 2020 (see: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cbaruba.org/cba/readBlob.do?id=6655" target="_blank">https://www.cbaruba.org/cba/readBlob.do?id=6655</a>).</p>

<h3>Australia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first COVID-19 case in Australia was
 confirmed on January 25, 2020. Social distancing measures were 
increasingly tightened in late March/early April, including by banning 
public gatherings of more than two people and shutting down 
non-essential businesses. After the National Cabinet announced a 
three-step plan on May 8 to relax COVID-19 restrictions, States and 
Territories eased regional containment measures. However, overseas 
travel remains banned, and any arrivals in Australia are quarantined for
 14 days. A recent regional COVID-19 resurgence triggered a renewed 
lockdown in metropolitan Melbourne from July 9. This was further 
tightened (stage 4 restrictions) on August 2. Restrictions (stage 3) 
were also put in place for the State of Victoria (outside of Melbourne) 
starting August 6. On September 6, the Victoria government announced a 
roadmap for easing restrictions, tied to declines in active COVID-19 
cases. Stage 4 restrictions in metropolitan Melbourne have been extended
 through September 28. Some States and Territories have eased regional 
travel restrictions. </p>
<p>Real GDP contracted by 7 percent q/q in the second quarter of 2020, 
and high-frequency indicators point to an incipient recovery in the 
third quarter.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>At the Commonwealth level, fiscal stimulus, consisting of 
expenditure and revenue measures worth A$183.8 billion (9.5 percent of 
GDP), has been put in place through FY2023-24, and the majority of which
 will be executed through FY2020-21. Measures include sizable JobKeeper 
wage subsidies (5.4 percent of GDP), income support to households, cash 
flow support to businesses, investment incentives, and targeted measures
 for affected regions and industries (including the HomeBuilder program 
supporting the construction industry). The Commonwealth government will 
also help finance a series of fast-track infrastructure projects across 
States and Territories (A$3.9 billion) and the arts and screen 
industries to support job creation under the JobMaker program, and has 
put in place a home care package to support senior citizens (A$0.3 
billion). The Commonwealth government provided free childcare to around 
one million families through mid-July (A$0.3 billion) and announced 
targeted support to the education system. In mid-July, the government 
announced extensions of the JobKeeper wage subsidies through March 2021 
and of the additional income support to households through December 
2020, with payment reductions to facilitate a gradual transition to a 
recovery. It also instituted a new JobTrainer skills package (A$2 
billion). Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment has been arranged with the 
State and Territory governments to provide a lump sum payment to help 
workers during their 14-day self-isolation period. The Commonwealth 
government will also invest in green technologies (A$1.9 billion) to 
lower emissions.  </p>
    <p>Other measures include an allocation of up to A$15 billion to 
invest in residential mortgage backed securities and asset backed 
securities to help funding for small banks and non-bank financial 
institutions, and loan guarantees between the Commonwealth government 
and participating banks to cover the immediate cash flow needs of SMEs 
(up to A$20 billion). In mid-July 2020, the latter scheme was extended 
through June 2021, with the maximum loan size raised from A$250,000 to 
A$1 million and the maximum maturity extended to five years. </p>
    <p>Separately, the Commonwealth government has committed to spend an
 additional amount of almost A$11.6 billion (0.6 percent of GDP) to 
strengthen the health system and protect vulnerable people, including 
those in aged care, from the outbreak of COVID-19. The Commonwealth 
government has also agreed with the States and the Territories to share 
the public health costs incurred by the States and Territories in 
treating the COVID-19.</p>
    <p>State and Territory governments also announced fiscal stimulus 
packages, together amounting to A$40 billion (2.1 percent of GDP), 
including payroll tax relief for businesses and relief for households, 
such as discount utility bills, cash payments to vulnerable households, 
support for health spending, construction, infrastructure packages, and 
green investment (renewable energy and technologies). </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The policy rate was cut by 25 basis points twice on March 3 and 
19, to 0.25 percent. On March 19, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) 
announced yield targeting on 3-year government bonds at around 0.25 
percent through purchases of government bonds in the secondary market. 
The RBA has maintained this policy setting in all subsequent monetary 
policy meetings (the last was held on September 1). To support 
liquidity, the RBA will conduct one-month and three-month repo 
operations daily until further notice. Repo operations of longer-term 
maturities (six months or longer) will be held at least weekly, as long 
as market conditions warrant. To assist with the smooth functioning of 
Australian capital markets, the RBA has broadened the range of eligible 
collateral for open market operations to include securities issued by 
non-bank corporations with an investment grade. The RBA has established a
 swap line with U.S. Fed for the provision of US dollar liquidity in 
amounts up to US$60 billion. To support the provision of credit, 
especially to SMEs during the period of disruption caused by COVID-19, 
the RBA established a A$90 billion Term Funding Facility (TFF) in March 
for banks to access three-year funding at 25 basis points until 
September. The RBA has recently expanded the TFF to A$200 billion and 
extended the access through June 2021. </p>
    <p>The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has 
provided temporary relief from its capital requirement, allowing banks 
to utilize some of their current large buffers to facilitate ongoing 
lending to the economy as long as minimum capital requirements are met. 
APRA also announced on March 30 that it is deferring its scheduled 
implementation of the Basel III reforms in Australia by one year to 
January 2023. APRA is also temporarily suspending the issuing of new 
licenses for at least six months in response to the economic uncertainty
 created by COVID-19. On July 27, APRA updated its guidance issued in 
April, which expected banks and insurers to consider deferring decisions
 on the level of dividends or approve a dividend at a materially reduced
 level, with a 50 percent cap on payout ratios for the remainder of this
 calendar year. APRA also expects banks to conduct regular stress 
testing to inform decision-making and make use of capital buffers to 
absorb the impact of stress to continue to lend to households and 
businesses.</p>
    <p>APRA announced on March 23 that loans on repayment deferrals in 
the context of COVID-19 need not be treated as being in arrears for a 
period of up to six months for capital adequacy and regulatory reporting
 purposes for borrowers who have been meeting their repayment 
obligations. On July 7, the Australian Banking Association announced 
that banks will extend the period of deferred repayments by up to 
another four months for affected borrowers. APRA also extended the 
regulatory approach on deferred repayments to cover a maximum period of 
up to 10 months until March 31, 2021. In addition, APRA clarified that 
loans that are restructured before March 31, 2021 to put the borrower on
 a sustainable financial footing may continue to be regarded as 
performing loans for capital adequacy purposes.</p>
    <p>Insolvency relief measures for businesses put in place by the 
Commonwealth government from March 2020 for six months as part of its 
response to COVID-19 have been extended through December 2020.</p>

<h3>Austria</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Daily new cases have climbed up 
significantly with the effective reproductive rate of above 1. A pickup 
in the infection rate has prompted the authorities to reintroduce 
mandatory mask wearing in shops, banks, and post offices, effective on 
July 24, 2020 and, in September, extended to indoors and public 
institutions. During the initial outbreak, the authorities progressively
 tightened containment measures between mid-March and mid-April.  By 
March 16, leaving home was banned by law with limited exceptions, 
restaurants and shops not delivering daily products were closed, and 
enforced by administrative and police measures, and a number of 
communities and regions were declared risk areas and put under 
quarantine. For all judicial and administrative procedures, the clock 
was put on hold to avoid hardship due to missed deadlines.  </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> A gradual re-opening of 
the economy has started after April 13, from small shops, construction 
and garden centers, while other stores and hairdressers were allowed to 
open at the beginning of May. By mid-May when religious services, 
outdoor sports, museums, libraries, and archives reopened, and the 
Bundesliga was allowed to restart. Open air markets and business 
premises are exempted from the mandate on mouth and nose protective 
masks since June 1. The re-opening process is expected to last through 
June though some steps were accelerated recently due to low infection 
rates, such as the reopening of the borders with Germany, Switzerland, 
Lichtenstein, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary from June 5. Since 
June 15, the standing obligation for all persons to wear a face mask was
 limited to public transportation, pharmacies and services when a 
1-meter distance cannot be maintained, or no other protective measures 
are available. On 16 June, travelling restrictions were lifted for most 
European countries. Adhering to EU policies, Austria lifted a travel ban
 with 15 countries, with the notable exceptions of US, Brazil, India, 
and Russia.  </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The total fiscal package announced on March 15 amounts to 38 
billion euros (about 9.5 percent of 2019 GDP). Financing includes: 4 
billion euros for the health care system, long-term care, short-term 
work, and to compensate self-employed, family- and micro-business for 
the loss of earnings related to the sickness; 9 billion euros in 
guarantees to companies, including exporters and the tourism industry; 
10 billion euros for the deferral of personal and corporate income taxes
 (for 2020), social security contributions (3 months), and VAT payments 
(until end-September 2020). The General Civil Code was enacted on March 
15 declaring COVID-19 a force majeure enabling companies to force 
workers to take up to two weeks of leave accumulated in previous years. 
On March 22, €22 million were earmarked for research and short-term work
 was extended to 3 months with the possibility to extend it by another 
three months (up to September). Under this provision working hours may 
be reduced to up to 10 percent (later revised to 30 percent), at 80 to 
90 percent of regular pay. Employers only pay the hours worked, while 
the rest is paid from the budget. From April 2, households could delay 
rent payments to their landlords until end-2020. Households and SMEs may
 also delay their debt servicing by 3 months. Funding for short-term 
work was increased from € 3 to € 5 billion on April 13, to € 10 billion 
on April 30, and again to € 12 billion on May 19 while the time frame 
for the submission of applications extended. The authorities are rolling
 out new fiscal measures including tax relief measures for the 
hospitality sector of € 500 million and support to non-profit 
organizations of € 700 million open for 6 months. To jump-start the 
economy, a new tax incentive was introduced for companies that recruit 
apprentices, with € 2,000 per position created during March 16 and 
October 31 of this year. On June 16, the package was increased to € 50 
billion (13 % of GDP).  Measures on the expenditure side include 
investment in climate protection, affordable housing, health, and 
digitalization and a one-off support for unemployed and families. 
Several specific tax relief measures are aimed at the agricultural and 
forestry sectors, culture and publishing. The reduction of the lowest 
income tax rate from 25 to 20 percent, planned for 2021, was brought 
forward and made retroactive to January 2020. Several measures are under
 discussion for possible extension. They include a new phase of 
short-term work arrangement (until March 2021), fixed cost subsidy 
(March 2021) pending on EU approval, and unemployment assistance 
(end-2020).</p>

<h3>Azerbaijan</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Azerbaijan has been adversely affected 
by COVID-19 and a collapse of oil prices. The authorities reported the 
first confirmed COVID-19 case on February 29, 2020.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 Operational Headquarters has been created under the 
Cabinet of Ministers, and working groups&nbsp;within various ministries 
and at the CBA have been tasked with developing specific response 
measures. To contain the spread of COVID-19, the authorities introduced a
 special quarantine regime (state of emergency) starting March 24. It 
included border closures, mandatory quarantine of citizens returning 
from abroad, prohibition of mass gatherings, restriction of domestic 
movements; closure of retail outlets, airports, and transportation hubs;
 social distancing, and disinfection of public spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>&nbsp;Starting May 4, the 
authorities began a staged relaxation of restrictions, enabling many 
businesses, facilities, and public areas to reopen and reestablishing 
freedom of private vehicular travel between cities and districts. On 
June 19, as new COVID-19 cases rose with the reopening (with cases 
doubling between June 1-18), the authorities announced retightening of 
the quarantine regime (including the closure of borders until August 1, 
closure of establishments such as shopping malls, cinemas, and museums 
in the capital and big cities, and requiring permits for people to leave
 their homes in these cities). On July 17, the special quarantine regime
 was extended in 13 cities and districts until August 31, with tighter 
provisions in place until August 5. With new inflections starting to 
decline in early August, the authorities relaxed some of the lockdown 
restrictions in 7 cities (e.g., a few beaches were reopened and the 
requirement to receive SMS permission to leave home was eased). On 
August 29, the special quarantine regime was extended until September 
30.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The authorities have increased spending on public health (AzN 8.3
 million or .01 percent of GDP) and created a COVID Response Fund for 
public health needs (AzN 114 million or 0.14 percent of GDP). The 
government transferred AzN 20 million (.02 percent of GDP) to the Fund, 
with additional contributions coming from the public and private 
sectors. Ten modular hospitals are expected to be built (one of which 
has been completed) adding 2,000 beds at an estimated cost of AzN 15.3 
million. Azerbaijan's government has also provided AzN 8.5 million ($5 
million) to the COVID-19 Fund as part of the WHO’s Strategic 
Preparedness and Response Plan.</p>
    <p>On April 4, the authorities announced support to the affected 
businesses and individuals in the amount of AzN 3.3 billion (4.1 percent
 of GDP).&nbsp; Measures aimed at redressing damage to entrepreneurs and
 supporting incomes include: partial coverage of salaries (AzN 215 
million); support to microentrepreneurs (AzN 80 million); temporary 
public jobs (AzN 54 million); subsistence and unemployment payments (AzN
 230 million); pensions (AzN 200 million); targeted social assistance 
(AzN 4.5 million); energy and education subsidies (AzN 20 million); 
allocation of additional funds to the Entrepreneurship Development Fund 
(AzN 50 million).</p>
    <p>On June 2, the President approved amendments to the Tax Code, 
providing tax benefits to businesses affected by the COVID pandemic. The
 amendments grant a one-year exemption from land and property tax to 
selected sectors, including tourism, passenger road transportation, and 
cultural facilities. Income taxpayers will also receive a 75 percent 
exemption and taxpayers filing under simplified procedures a 50 percent 
exemption. Moreover, the rental property tax in the COVID-affected areas
 is reduced from 14 percent to 7 percent.</p>
    <p>On June 23, the Cabinet of Ministers announced a one-time 
extension of social assistance announced as part of the April 4 relief 
package for the unemployed and low-income people who lost earnings 
because of the special quarantine regime. An additional lump-sum payment
 of AzN 190 will be paid once to the individuals who received social 
assistance under the April 4 relief package.</p>
    <p>On August 6, the parliament passed a revised 2020 budget which 
reflected a lower oil price ($35 a barrel) and growth assumptions (-5 
percent). The transfer from the Oil Fund was increased by AzN 850 
million to offset lower state budget (SB) revenues, while SB 
expenditures were increased by some AzN 600 million. Overall, the 2020 
SB deficit has increased from AzN 2.8 billion to AzN 3.4 billion (4.8 
percent of GDP), while the consolidated government deficit increases 
from AzN 1.9 billion to AzN 8.4 billion (11.9 percent of GDP).</p>

    <p>On March 19, the CBA left the refinancing rate unchanged at 7¼ percent, but&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbar.az/press-release-2542/on-parameters-of-interest-rate-corridor">raised</a>&nbsp;the floor of the interest rate corridor (within a de facto floor system) by 125 bps to 6¾ percent.</p>
    <p>On May 1, the CBA lowered the ceiling of the interest rate 
corridor by 100 bps to 8 percent. The authorities have&nbsp;extended the
 blanket deposit guarantee until December 4, 2020. The guarantee covers 
all manat (foreign currency) deposits within a 10 (2½) percent interest 
rate cap.</p>
    <p>On June 19, the CBA lowered the refinancing rate by 25 bps to 7 
percent, lowered the ceiling of the interest rate corridor to 7½ 
percent, and lowered the floor of the corridor by 25 bps to 6½ percent.</p>
    <p>On July 30, the CBA lowered the refinancing rate by 25 bps to 6¾ 
percent, and similarly shifted the floor and ceiling of the corridor 
downwards to 6¼ and 7¼, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>On September 18, the CBA lowered the refinancing rate by 25 bps 
to 6½ percent, and similarly adjusted the ceiling and floor rates to 
maintain a +/- 50 bps interest rate corridor.  </p>
    <p>On April 23, the CBA undertook several measures to assist the 
financial sector. This included: (I) a relation of capital requirements 
(system wide and the countercyclical capital buffer) and risk weights on
 mortgage loans; (ii) a moratorium on late fees and interest rate 
penalties; (iii) guarantees on insurance premiums; and (iv) suspension 
of inspections of credit institutions.</p>
    <p>On April 27, the CBA appointed temporary administrators in four 
banks. Two of the banks were closed on April 28, with the other two 
closed on May 12.</p>
    <p>On May 19, the CBA signed a $200 million swap agreement with the 
EBRD, aimed at improving the flow of financial resources to the real

<h3>The Bahamas</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The Bahamas has so far reported 3467 
confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 77 deaths (as of September 22). The 
Bahamas initially reopened its borders for international travel on July 
1, as part of a phased plan that began with a reopening for boaders and 
private aviation on June 15. However, following the reopening, confirmed
 cases increased rapidly, leading the government to issue a new order 
for travel procedures and restrictions on July 22 and new lockdown 
restrictions in August. All international travelers are allowed in but 
must at their own expense quarantine for 14 days at a government 
facility and at the end of the 14 days period submit a negative PCR 
test. For inter-island travel, the requirement of the PCR test results 
was removed, except for New Providence but a 14-day quarantine is still 
required upon arrival at destination. Lockdown restrictions have been 
gradually rolled back since late August. Starting September 8, 
restrictions on activities were eased further, such as providing indoor 
dining and in-store services under specific protocols (except for New 
Providence) and extending beach access time for all islands. On 
September 23rd, the resumption of normal commercial and additional 
social activities was announced for most islands. The 10pm to 5am curfew
 remains in place for Grand Bahama, as well as Emergency Powers Order in
 Abaco and New Providence. Phase 3 reopening is scheduled to begin on 
October 15, with hotels and beaches available to visitors abiding by a 
14-day “Vacation-In-Place” (VIP) guideline, while excursions and tours 
will recommence on November 1. </p>

<h3>Bahrain</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Bahrain has been hit by the spread of 
COVID-19 and by the recent sharp decline in oil prices. The first case 
of COVID-19 was reported on February 24, 2020. To contain the rapid 
spread of COVID-19, the authorities have expanded social distancing and 
stay-at-home measures: closing educational institutions, retail shops, 
restaurants and cinemas; suspending flights to infected areas; 
suspending prayers in mosques; rescheduling major events; restricting 
gathering to 5 people; introducing mandatory use of masks while in 
public; and switching to remote working at public entities. Recently 
introduced measures include a reduction of private schools’ tuitions by 
5-10 percent and a provision to accommodate expatriates in temporary 
housing where social distancing practices can be maintained. The 
authorities are also expanding intensive care units (ICU) facilities 
should the existing stock of ICU beds become insufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening measures.</strong> In a series of steps over April 
9-23, the authorities have permitted reopening of retail stores subject 
to some strict operational conditions. Stores that reopen should require
 every customer to wear a mask, operate with a reduced number of 
employees, and prevent overcrowding at their premises, ensuring 
continuous sterilization of premises setting up queues to enter to 
enforce social distancing. </p>

    <p>A BD 560 million ($1.5 billion or 4.2 percent of GDP) stimulus 
package to respond to the economic distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic
 was announced on March 17. The package, effective for a period of three
 months from April, comprises seven initiatives: (i) payment of salaries
 for Bahrainis working in the private sector to be financed from the 
unemployment fund; (ii) payment of electricity and water bills for 
Bahraini individuals and companies; (iii) exemption of commercial 
entities from municipalities' fees; (iv) exemption of tourist facilities
 from tourism fees; (v) exemption of industrial and commercial entities 
from paying rent to the government; (vi) doubling of the size of the 
liquidity fund to support SMEs; (vii) and redirection of Tamkeen (a 
semi-autonomous government agency that provides loans and assistance to 
businesses) programs to support adversely affected companies, as well as
 restructuring of all debts issued by Tamkeen. In addition, to respond 
to urgent health needs created by COVID-19, the Cabinet has authorized 
the Minister of Finance and National Economy to withdraw from the 
general account BD 177 million ($470 million or 1.3 percent of GDP), 
which has subsequently been added to the 2020 budget on July 13, 2020. 
On April 8, 2020 a further BD 5.5 million enhancement to social benefits
 for lower income families was announced. On April 20 the authorities 
announced their objective to reduce non-priority government agencies 
expenditure by up to 30 percent and delay some capital expenditure to 
accommodate lower oil revenues due to the decline in oil prices. Other 
measures announced include the extension of the existing package to 
drivers, driving instructors and nurseries, as well as a proposal to 
delay the collection of some claims on nationals.</p>
    <p>On June 29, the authorities approved new measures to extend some 
of the support adopted in the previous package. The new measures include
 i) payment of 50 percent of salaries for Bahrainis working in the most 
affected sectors for a further three months starting in July 2020; ii) 
extend the payment of electricity and water bills for Bahrainis for a 
further three months starting in July 2020; iii) reduce by 50 percent 
work permit fees and exempt the most affected sectors from work permit 
fee for three months starting in July 2020; and iv) expand financial 
support to hard hit sectors through Tamkeen.</p>
    <p>At end-July 2020 the authorities approved the following new 
measures: i) for three months, exempting industrial companies operating 
in the industrial zone and exporting more than 30 percent of production 
from paying rent; ii) exempting companies hardest hit by the crisis from
 paying the commercial record registration or renewal fee for 2020; iii)
 exempting households from paying municipality fees on their first 
residence for three months; and iv) exempting tourist facilities from 
paying the tourism fee for the third quarter of 2020. </p>
    <p>At end-September 2020 the authorities approved the sponsoring of 
electricity and water bills in first residences for Bahrainis for a 
further three months starting in October 2020.</p>

    <p>On March 17, the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) expanded its 
lending facilities to banks by up to BHD 3.7 billion ($10 billion or 28 
percent of GDP) to facilitate deferred debt payments and extension of 
additional credit. The CBB has also followed the Fed’s interest rate 
cuts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: the one-week deposit facility
 rate was cut (in two steps) from 2.25% to 1.0%, the overnight deposit 
rate from 2.0% to 0.75%, and the overnight lending rate (in one step) 
from 4.0% to 2.45%. Other key measures to support banks and their 
clients include: (i) reducing the cash reserve ratio for retail banks 
from 5% to 3%; (ii) relaxing loan-to-value ratios for new residential 
mortgages; (iii) capping fees on debit cards; and (iv) requesting banks 
to offer a six-month deferral of repayments without interest or penalty 
and to refrain from blocking customers' accounts if a customer has lost 
his or her employment. The CBB is also following up with banks on 
suitability of banks' contingency plans. At end-September, the loan 
deferral was extended to the end of year. Finally, the CBB has also been
 following up with banks on suitability of banks' contingency plans.</p>

<h3>Bangladesh</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Bangladesh reported the first confirmed 
cases of COVID-19 on March 8. On March 23, the government declared a 
general holiday from March 26 to May 30, leading to the closure of 
government offices, private offices, and courts, and shorter operating 
hours for commercial banks. On April 8, the government restricted 
operations in Rohingya refugee camps to critical services and assistance
 only, citing the need to minimize risk within the camp setting.  While 
the number of cases remains low, reluctance to be tested presents a 
challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>On May 28, the authorities
 announced that closures and movement restrictions would be gradually 
lifted starting May 31. Civil servants have returned to their offices 
and public transport in Dhaka has resumed. Beyond the domestic impact of
 the health crisis, the two main channels through which the Bangladesh 
economy will be impacted are remittances and exports of ready-made 
garments (RMG). Remittances represent over 5 percent of GDP ($16.4 
billion in FY 19), and a majority of migrant workers are based in Gulf 
countries that are affected by the abrupt decline in oil prices. The RMG
 sector accounts for more than eighty percent of the country’s exports. 
The industry has been hit by the cancellation or postponement of several
 billion US dollars in orders from major retailers in importing 
countries. Another concern for the authorities stems from historic 
monsoon floods which affected close to four million people, with nearly 
one-third of the country underwater. This will likely have a negative 
impact on agricultural production, possibly leading to higher food 
imports.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government has introduced a series of fiscal measures to 
contain and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. At end-March, 
the Ministry of Finance issued a revised budget for FY20 including 
additional resources to fund the Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 
Preparedness and Response Plan and expanding existing transfer programs 
that benefit the poor. Increased allocation has been made to the Open 
Market Sale program to facilitate the purchase of rice at one-third of 
the market price, and the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief is 
distributing food supplies at the district level. On March 31, the 
Ministry of Finance announced a Tk. 50 billion (about USD 588 million) 
stimulus package for exporting industries to be channeled through a 
refinance scheme operated by Bangladesh Bank. The amount of the loan was
 increased in July-August by an additional Tk. 60 billion following 
pressure from factory owners. Loan proceeds will be used to pay worker 
salaries, primarily through mobile financial services, and the scheme is
 expected to benefit close to 4 million workers for a four-month period.
 Exporting firms that have laid off workers will not qualify for the 
loans. The Ministry of Finance will also subsidize interest payments on 
up to Tk. 500 billion in working capital loans by scheduled banks to 
businesses. On April 15th, the Prime Minister announced the allocation 
of Tk. 21.3 billion under a housing scheme for the homeless, Tk. 7.6 
billion for poor people having lost their jobs as a result of the 
pandemic, Tk. 7.5 billion to provide health insurance for government 
employees most at risk, and a Tk. 1 billion bonus payment for government
 doctors and health workers treating COVID-19 patients. The Prime 
Minister also announced that the government would cover Tk. 20 billion 
in interest payments on behalf of 13.8 million loan recipients 
negatively impacted by the national shutdown. The National Board of 
Revenue has suspended duties and taxes on imports of medical supplies, 
including protective equipment and test kits. The FY21 Budget presented 
on 11 June includes higher allocations for health, agriculture, and 
social safety net programmes. As a precautionary measure, the government
 has decided that until further notice, funds from the budget for 
low-priority development projects will not be released. It has 
approached international financial institutions and bilateral 
development partners seeking budget support.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The focus of Bangladesh Bank (BB) is to ensure that there is 
adequate liquidity in the financial system to support the operations of 
financial institutions, and it has announced that it will buy treasury 
bonds and bills from banks. The repo rate was lowered from 6 percent to 
5.75 percent effective March 24th and was further reduced to 5.25 
percent effective April 12th. The repo rate was cut again from 5.25 
percent to 4.75 percent recently, effective July 30th.  The CRR was 
initially reduced from 5 percent to 4.5 percent (daily-basis) and from 
5.5 percent to 5 percent (bi-weekly basis), with a further reduction to 
3.5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, from April 15. Recently, CRR 
was cut to 1.5% (daily basis) and 2.0% (bi-weekly basis) for offshore 
banking operation, effective July 1, and 1.0% (daily basis) and 1.5% 
(by-weekly basis) for NBFIs, effective June 1. BB has also raised the 
advance-deposit ratio (ADR) and investment-deposit ratio (IDR) by 2 
percent to facilitate credit to the private sector and improve liquidity
 in the banking system. The Export Development Fund was raised to $5 
billion, with the interest rate now fixed at 2 percent and the 
refinancing limit increased. BB has created several refinancing schemes 
amounting to a total of Tk 380 billion, a 360-day tenor special repo 
facility and a credit guarantee scheme to support exporters, farmers, 
SMEs and to facilitate the implementation of the government stimulus 
packages. To further support farmers, BB also announced an agriculture 
subsidy program that will take effect for 15 months until mid-2021. In 
addition, BB has taken measures to delay non-performing loan 
classification, relax loan rescheduling policy for Non-Bank Financial 
Institutions (NBFIs), waive credit card fees and interests, suspend loan
 interest payments, impose restrictions on bank dividend payments, 
extend tenures of trade instruments, and ensure access to financial 
services.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Foreign exchange rules were eased by Bangladesh Bank to provide 
foreign currency to the Bangladeshi nationals who are visiting abroad 
and facing problem in returning home due to travel disruptions, and to 
allow foreign owned/controlled companies operating in Bangladesh to 
access short term working capital loans from their parent 
companies/shareholders abroad to meet actual needs for payments of 
3-month wages and salary. International factoring was introduced to 
accelerate exports. BB also resumed sales of the US dollar to offset 
extra pressure on the market caused by lower remittance inflows 
following the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<h3>Barbados</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The government took swift actions to 
contain the spread of the virus. Within days of the first confirmed case
 (March 16), measures to activate isolation and treatment centers, 
impose limits on public gatherings, and establish supplementary medical 
facilities were taken. On April 3, a 24-hour curfew became effective 
restricting non-essential personnel to their residences and closing 
non-essential businesses. Enhanced screening measures are in place at 
all ports of entry but the mandatory 14-day quarantine for all travelers
 arriving in Barbados has been replaced with a testing program to 
facilitate the resumption of tourism. Spillovers from the global 
pandemic to the critical tourism sector have been significant with the 
shut-down of commercial airlift at end-March, which resulted in 
widespread labor furloughs and temporary hotel closures. Commercial 
airlift resumed on a limited basis in July but prospects for the 
recovery of tourism remain highly uncertain. The virtual collapse in 
tourism in recent months—which accounts for 40 percent of economic 
activity—will significantly depress overall economic activity in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the Economy. </strong>The authorities adopted a 
four-phase plan to reopen the economy. The shift to phase 2 occurred on 
May 4 with a modest relaxation of social and economic restrictions. 
Specifically, the 24hr curfew was replaced with a nightly curfew and the
 resumption of construction, manufacturing, and food 
production/distribution services. Phase 3 commenced on May 18 with the 
phased re-opening of remaining businesses and trades but with 
restrictions, such as social distancing requirements, temperature 
testing protocols, and limited admittance to retail spaces. More 
recently, the curfew was lifted effective July 1 and quarantine 
procedures for travelers arriving in Barbados have been relaxed ahead of
 the resumption of commercial airlift in July. Phase 4, which is 
characterized as the resumption of life as normal, will be triggered 
upon development and procurement of a vaccine.</p>

    <p>The Government of Barbados (GoB) identified upfront emergency 
health and capital expenditures needed to manage and mitigate the spread
 of infection. This includes resources to refurbish the hospital and 
clinics, build isolation centers, and provision critical medications and
 supplies. In addition, the GoB will boost priority capital spending and
 introduce social programs for displaced workers to mitigate the effects
 of COVID-19 on the economy. This includes infrastructure investment to 
renovate schools, government buildings, and a key industrial complex and
 the introduction of a Household Survival Program. The latter involves a
 minimum income for households made unemployed by COVID-19 and 
supplemental unemployment benefits though the National Insurance Scheme.
 In addition, the clearance of roughly 1 percent of GDP in outstanding 
income tax and VAT arrears will provide an infusion of liquidity to 
households and businesses, and establishment of a Tourism Loan facility 
will provide urgent working capital and investment loans to hotels. The 
authorities recently rolled out a deferred public wage-savings scheme 
(BOSS) to help finance a stepped-up capital investment program intended 
to boost growth while the tourism sector recovers from the COVID shock. 
On balance, the authorities are targeting a 1 percent of GDP primary 
surplus in 2020 as compared to the 3 percent target announced during the
 March budget presentation. </p>
    <p>On September 15, the Governor General announced additional policy
 measures during a Throne Speech to open a new session of Parliament. 
Key initiatives include a 12-month jobs program and a tourism-sector 
stimulus and transformation package (available for up to two years). The
 Governor General reiterated the government’s commitment to long-term 
debt reduction—which underpins the ongoing financial arrangement with 
the IMF—while indicating that a reduction in the debt-GDP ratio may not 
be possible during next two years as the economy works through the

deposit-taking institution manage the economic fallout from the 
coronavirus shock. Specifically: i) the Bank’s discount rate at which it
 provides overnight lending to banks and deposit-taking non-banks 
licensed under the Financial Institutions Act was reduced from 7 percent
 to 2 percent; ii) the securities ratio for banks was lowered from 17.5 
percent to 5 percent; iii) the 1.5 percent securities ratio for non-bank
 deposit taking licensees was eliminated; and, iv) the Bank indicated it
 stands ready to make collateralized loans for up to six months as 
liquidity support for licensees. These measures follow an agreement 
brokered by the GoB for commercial banks to provide forbearance in the 
form a 6-month debt-payment moratorium for individuals and business 
directly impacted by COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was
 reported on February 28. The government has been implementing a range 
of measures to delay the spread of the disease and to support 
individuals and businesses. Containment measures currently in 
place—limited relative to other countries—include travel restrictions 
(e.g., cancelations of international flights and ground transportation),
 social distancing (e.g., self-isolation rules for the sick, and their 
first and second-level contacts; and a ban on gatherings/events with 
international participation), and recommendations for schools and 
education. In some regions such as Minsk, there has also been a 
cancelation of public events, and additional recommendations for work, 
education and businesses.. In order to facilitate travel abroad, the 
Ministry of Health has developed a certificate of the absence of Covid, 
and is identifying clinics where the certificate and a test can be 
obtained for a fee. Policy measures are elaborated below. First 
re-opening measures became effective in mid-June: The national airline 
Belavia continues to update its international flight schedule (flights 
to Russia were resumed in late September), restrictions on transit 
truckers were lifted, and self-isolation rules for travelers returning

<h3>Belgium</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Belgium registered the first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on February 4, 2020.&nbsp; The minority government—which 
had been granted enhanced executive powers until June 30, 2020—has 
implemented a range of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.belgium.be/en/news/2020/coronavirus_reinforced_measures" target="_blank">measures</a>&nbsp;to
 reduce the spread of the coronavirus, including closures of schools and
 all non-essential activities, a ban on all gatherings, limiting 
movement to essential needs, ban of non-essential travel abroad. The 
economy contracted by 3.5 percent and 12.1 percent (q/q) in the first 
and second quarters of 2020, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Since early May, the government has been implementing a phased <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.belgium.be/en/news/2020/measures_taken_national_security_council_24_april_2020" target="_blank">reopening plan</a>
 conditional on health outcomes that saw the gradual reopening of 
manufacturing, business services, and retail sectors (from May 4 and May
 18); hospitality, cultural, non-contact sports activities, and 
religious services (from June 8); and recreational activities and events
 (from July 1, subject to visitor caps). Following an uptick in cases 
from mid-July, reopenings have been put on hold, decision-making 
regarding localized restrictions further decentralized, and restrictions
 tightened. While restrictions were partially <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.premier.be/en/managing-health-situation-start-school-year-all-and-outlook" target="_blank">eased in late August</a>
 (on shopping and events), strict social distancing rules (incl. a 
“social bubble” of 5 persons per family) were to remain in place until 
at least end-September. Schools started to gradually reopen from May 18,
 and fully reopened in September, with in-person classes. Universities 
reopened on September 21. Travel restrictions have gradually and largely
 been lifted since mid-June, though remain in place for countries where 
Covid-19 risks are considered high. On September 24, the government 
decided to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.premier.be/fr/Lancement-de-la-strategie-de-gestion-des-risques-responsabilisation-des-citoyens" target="_blank">relax some containment measures</a>
 from October 1, including allowing for more social contact (the bubble 
of 5 will apply per person instead of per family), no longer requiring 
face masks outdoors where 1.5m distance can be respected, and shortening
 the quarantine period from 14 to 7 days.

<h3>Belize</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first case of COVID-19 was reported 
on March 23. In response, the authorities closed borders and the 
international airport, closed schools, and implemented mandatory 
quarantines. They also declared a national state of emergency and 
nighttime curfew during April, under which people were not allowed to 
leave their homes except for buying essential goods, attending medical 
appointments, or to work in essential services. The national state of 
emergency was later extended until end-June, although with less 
stringent regulations. These measures we effective to contain the 
pandemic until early June. However, there have been a second wave of 
infections since then, with the number of cases increasing to 818 and 
the number of deaths to 12 as of August 27.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic came when the economy was already in recession 
due to drought and a slowdown in tourism in the second half of 2019. The
 impact of the pandemic on the economy is projected to be severe due to 
the collapse in tourism activity and the indirect effects of the 
necessary containment and mitigation measures. As a result, Belize is 
projected to experience a deep recession in 2020 and only a gradual 
recovery as the pandemic wanes.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong>  The national state of 
emergency ended in June, with more businesses allowed to reopen. The 
country was planning to reopen to foreign tourists from mid-August, but 
these plans have been postponed due to the resurgence of Covid-19 cases.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of August 27, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Belize has announced fiscal stimulus amounting to BZ$25 million 
(about 1 percent of GDP) in 2020 to provide short term relief to 
employees affected by the crisis, especially those in the tourism 
sector. So far, more than 40,000 applications for unemployment relief 
have been approved. The government has also introduced a bill to 
parliament that seeks to increase the maturity of treasury notes by an 
additional ten years and freeze the annual salary increment of public 
sector employees in 2020.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Central Bank of Belize has adopted prudential measures to 
maintain the flow of credit in the economy: (i) reducing the statutory 
cash reserve requirements; (ii) extending the time period to classify 
targeted non-performing loans in sectors such as restaurants, 
transportation and distribution companies, and other affected areas, 
from 3 months to 6 months; (iii) encouraging domestic banks and credit 
unions to provide grace periods for servicing interest and/or principal 
of commercial and ancillary loans, as needed and where commercially 
viable; (iv) reducing risk-weights for banks on loans in the tourism 
sector from 100 percent to 50 percent; and (v) reviewing financial 
institutions’ business continuity and cybersecurity plans to ensure that
 an adequate level of financial services will be available to the 
public.</p>

<h3>Benin</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Benin reported its first COVID-19 case 
on March 16, 2020. The authorities have implemented strong containment 
and social distancing measures since March 31, including the partial 
lockdown (cordon sanitaire) around ten cities most exposed to the 
pandemic to isolate the contaminated population and contain the spread 
of the virus. They have also (i) significantly limited the transit of 
people across land borders; (ii) restricted the issuance of entry visas 
to the country; (iii) introduced a systematic and compulsory quarantine 
of all people coming to Benin by air; (iv) suspended all public 
gatherings; (v) introduced a ban on the movement of public 
transportation; and (vi) made wearing face mask in public compulsory. 
The economic impact of the pandemic has already begun to materialize 
through higher Eurobond spreads and lower cotton prices, while a more 
widespread domestic outbreak could significantly impair exports, further
 reduce confidence and capital inflows, and cause a significant 
disruption to economic activity. In addition to Covid-19, Benin is also 
being impacted by the closure of border with Nigeria since end-August 
2019. Government policy is responding to both developments.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The authorities have 
announced measures to gradually start reopening the economy, Middle 
schools, high schools and universities resumed their activities on May 
11, 2020, while the kindergartens and day-care centers will remain 
closed until the start of the forthcoming school year. Public 
transportation, places of worship and bars resumed their activities on 
June 2, 2020. Finally, the cordon sanitaire was lifted on May 6, 2020, 
once the government’s mass screening plans were put in place. For this 
purpose, the authorities installed laboratories in each of Benin’s 12 
departments and started a nationwide screening program. Since the start 
of the program, the authorities have conducted over 67,000 coronavirus 
tests throughout the country. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The authorities have developed an ambitious response plan to 
covid-19 pandemic, which aims at raising healthcare spending, granting 
cash transfers to vulnerable households, and providing support to 
impacted businesses. More specifically, the response package consists 
of: (i) an increase in health spending by CFAF 60 billion to cover the 
cost of purchasing medical equipment, the construction of temporary 
centers to care for people who are sick, and quarantine arrangements for
 at-risk populations; (ii) a total of CFAF 50 billion to help the most 
vulnerable segments of the population through various forms of cash 
transfers; and (iii) a CFAF40 billion to support struggling businesses 
through targeted and temporary tax exemptions and a relaxation of 
certain payment rules. The cost of this plan for 2020 has been set at 
CFAF 150 billion (1.7 percent of GDP).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic 
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks’ 
demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on
 economic activity. The BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a 
fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby 
allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25
 basis points lower than before the crisis. On June 22, the Monetary 
Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the
 monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO 
has also: (i) extended the collateral framework to access central bank 
refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private 
companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance 
institutions to accommodate demands from customers with Covid19-related 
repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period debt 
service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims 
as non-performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of 
electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a 
special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for 
limited amounts of 3-month "Covid-19 T-Bills" to be issued by each WAEMU
 sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current 
pandemic. The amount of such special T-Bills issued by Benin amounted to
 1.5 percent of GDP. Benin has been recently allowed to issue the 
equivalent of 1.5 percent of GDP of new 3-months Covid-19 T-Bills that 
banks  may refinance with the BCEAO for their term to maturity at 2 
percent. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the 
five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basle II/III 
bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital 
adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 
9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead
 of 2022 initially planned. </p>

<h3>Bhutan</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Bhutan confirmed its first case of 
COVID-19 on March 6, 2020. Until July 30, active cases had flattened, 
with no evidence of community transmission and no deaths. However, on 
August 11th the government announced its first nationwide lockdown, 
following report of a COVID-19 positive case in a returning traveler who
 had been released from quarantine. A National Taskforce endorsed a 
guideline that ensures that every zone is a self-contained unit with 
access to essential shops and services. Under the lockdown, all schools,
 offices, and commercial establishments are to remain closed. Since the 
start of the pandemic, the economic impact of COVID-19 has been 
substantial, driven by the adverse impact on the tourism and related 
services sector.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>The PMO office announced a
 three phased unlocking starting August 31 and incrementally through 
September 7. On June 19, 2020, the Prime Minister announced a range of 
changes including easing of restrictions for some ‘lower risk’ 
businesses, and all government agencies to discontinue "work from home" 
from June 22. All agencies are encouraged to minimize face-to-face 
interactions and make use of technology for meetings and other official 
correspondences. Bhutan started imposing containment measures 
immediately after the first case, with restriction of entry of foreign 
tourists initially for two weeks but extended afterwards and closure of 
schools in three cities. On March 22, Bhutan sealed off its land borders
 as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19. For 
non-Bhutanese, exits are allowed. Incoming non-Bhutanese are scrutinized
 and quarantined where applicable. On March 27, more containment 
measures were imposed on public gatherings, travel (within and outside 
Bhutan), business and entertainment, games and sports and civil service,
 corporate, private, and other agencies. With the resumption of domestic
 air travel in India from May 25th and train services from June 1st, the
 Bhutanese in India who wish to return to the country can now take 
Indian domestic airlines. Upon arrival in Bhutan, they will have to 
report to the relevant COVID-19 task force for the mandatory 21-day 
quarantine.</p>

    <li>
    <p>The government announced a National Resilience Fund for 
mitigating COVID-19 linked job losses and salary cuts. The support 
included grant for individuals directly affected by the pandemic and 
full interest waiver on loans contracted since April 10, 2020 until June
 2020. These measures were extended until September 2020, and partial 
(50 percent) interest waiver will continue until March 2021. In 
addition, fiscal stimulus in the FY 2020-21 budget includes the 
implementation of an Economic Contingency Plan (ECP) aimed at helping 
different sectors, including tourism resilience, agriculture, Build 
Bhutan and improvement of farm roads over and above annual budget (Nu 4 
billion) and allocating higher level of capital outlay to frontload and 
accelerate activities from the 12th Five Year Plan. Current expenditure 
has been rationalized in response to expected fall in revenues and to 
ensure that it is covered by the domestic revenue. A budget of Nu.1.3 
billion has been re-appropriated for health, essential food and fuel, 
quarantine and related initiatives. Support will be provided to FCB to 
stock essential food and non-food items. It is deepening fiscal 
decentralization with upscaling of national grants. Other measures: an 
additional resource of Nu. 2 billion will be provided to the Ministry of
 Health to meet health-related spending; Business Income tax (BIT) and 
Corporate Income tax (CIT) filing for the income year 2019 was deferred 
until June 30, 2020 and tax payments, for tourism and related sectors 
(hotel, airlines and tour operators) are deferred until December 31, 
2020, while for other sectors until September 30, 2020; deferred payment
 of sales tax and customs duty on essential items (March to June 2020); 
waiver of payment of rent and other charges (April-December 2020) by 
tourism-related business entities leasing government properties, 
deferral of electricity charges payment for industry (till December 
2020), free electricity and wi-fi services to hotels serving as 
quarantine facility (July-September 2020). As of May 25, the government 
will be refunding the 5 percent sales tax collected on telecom services 
collected on or after January 16, 2020. The government is mobilizing 
additional resources such as grants and concessional borrowing as well 
as bilateral and in-kind financing to support capital spending.

    <li>
    <p>Effective April 14, Phase I monetary relief measures were 
introduced by the RMA. Many of these measures were extended under Phase 
II (July 8), including the waiver of interest on loans (until September 
2020) and partial waiver (until March 2021), extension of deferred 
monthly loan instalment repayment (until June 2021), granting financial 
institutions the provision of bridging loans as concessional term-based 
loan (5% interest rate for the tenure of the loan) for CIT and BIT 
filing business agencies, conversion of concessional working capital 
soft loans to tourism, manufacturing and wholesale business (April-June 
2020) to term loans for 4 years at 5% rate, extension of soft loans to 
cottage and small industries through the CSI Development Bank 
(microloans at 2 percent interest for agriculture and rural activities 
and working capital loans at 4 percent interest rate) by 12 months to 
June 2021. The government and the RMA will conduct an in-depth 
assessment of NPLs from July 2020 to facilitate rehabilitation and/or 
foreclosures of NPLs. To facilitate the implementation of  Phase I 
measures, RMA further reduced the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 200 basis 
point to 7 percent. RMA will open a liquidity window for FSPs 
(inter-bank borrowing system) and will release liquidity through 
reduction of CRR only if the liquidity crunch is of a systemic nature. 
The RMA is further promoting the use of digital banking platforms during
 the current lockdown situation.

<h3>Bolivia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> While Bolivia was initially spared from 
the full force of the pandemic, the situation has deteriorated in recent
 months. As of September 24, there are 131,453 confirmed cases, and 
7,693 deaths have been reported. The government has taken a series of 
measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including a generalized 
lockdown, entailing the temporary closure of many businesses, border 
closure and suspension of schools, and postponed the general elections 
scheduled initially on May 3. On March 25, the authorities announced the
 state of health emergency until April 15 and further tightened the 
quarantine orders, completely closing the borders, restricting the 
movement of people to once a week, and prohibiting movements of vehicles
 except for security and health reasons. The national quarantine has 
been extended several times and will remain in effect through September 
30. with reopening modifications (see below). Wearing facemasks in 
public places is now mandatory, and schools and other public and 
religious events remain suspended. Efforts are underway to strengthen 
Bolivia’s health care system, which has struggled to accommodate the 
demands arising from the pandemic. In recent months, the interim 
President, several members of the cabinet, and the President of the 
central bank have tested positive for COVID-19. National elections have 
been delayed twice (now scheduled for October 18) owing to the pandemic.
  </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> From May 11, Bolivia 
implemented a “dynamic quarantine”. Departments and cities will be 
classified into three categories: High, Medium, Low Risk, with 
evaluations every seven days. Those at high risk will be subject to 
rigid rules, and the others will have more flexibility. The following 
restrictions remain until August 31 at all risk levels: border closure, 
suspension of national and international flights, suspension of school 
activities, suspension of public events, social distance of one and a 
half meters, use of masks in public places. For medium risk locations: 6
 hours work per day, use of motorcycles and bikes for work purposes, 
business hours from 06:00 to 15:00, circulation until 17:00. For low 
risk: 8 hours work per day, business hours from 06:00 to 16:00, from 
19:00 to 05:00 confinement for those under 18, those over 60 can leave 
home from 06:00 to 12:00. For the whole country, the food delivery 
service is allowed from 09:00 to 22:00. The bank system will work from 
Monday to Friday from 07:00 to 15:00. Departmental and municipal 
governments will determine commercial activity and other services not 
governed by the national decree and may add restrictions as needed by 
local conditions.</p>
<p>On April 17, the IMF approved Bolivia’s request for emergency 
financial assistance of about US$327 million under the Rapid Financing 
Instrument. The loan has not been approved by the Legislative Assembly 
in Bolivia due to stiff resistance from the majority party in Congress, 
Movement to Socialism (MAS). As of August 12, the Central Bank 
eliminated the RFI financing from its statistical records. </p>

    <p>The authorities have provided direct relief payments of about $US
 73 per child to households with children in public schools, a measure 
calculated to provide most of its benefits to poorer households. This 
payment was extended to students in private schools from May 18. In 
addition, the government instituted a program (Canasta Familiar) of 
direct payments for food to 1.5 million of families ($US 58 per family),
 pay the electric energy bills for three months for the consumers with 
lower consumption, and pay 50 percent of the potable water and gas for 
all households. From April 30, the government will also provide $US 73 
to citizens who do not receive any other benefits or draw a salary from 
the public or private sector. The authorities also postponed the payment
 of some taxes (corporate income tax, VAT, and transaction tax) with the
 possibility to pay them in tranches. Payment of corporate income tax 
was deferred till May, and independent workers are allowed to claim tax 
deductions against their expenses on health, schooling, food and related
 expenditures. The government is creating a fund of approx. $US 219 
million to support the operations of micro, small and medium businesses.
 This fund will provide soft loans to companies to pay wage bills 
without layoffs for two months (companies can withdraw $US 1230 per 
employee, repayable in 18 months). Imports of respiratory equipment in 
the amount of $200 million is planned, while ICU capacity is being 
doubled. </p>
    <p>Two new transfers to households were announced (pending in 
Congress): Bono Salud for all individuals who previously received the 
universal transfer. And Bono Contra el Hambre, for all individuals 
eligible for the universal transfer and mothers who are already 
recipients of targeted cash transfer and people with disabilities. </p>
    <p>The following 5 financial tools are implemented to inject resources into the economy and preserve 4 million jobs (announced):</p>
    <p>a) Fondo de reactivación (FORE): The objective of this fund is to
 partially finance the reprogramming of credits granted to companies in 
the sectors of tourism, hotels and restaurants, manufacturing, 
construction, agricultural and forestry, commerce, transport, storage 
and communications, among others and  through the financial 
intermediation entities. Amount: Bs.12,000 million (USD 1,740 million).</p>
    <p> b) Fondo de garantía sectorial (FOGASEC): The purpose of this 
one is to guarantee: a) new loans granted by bank and non-bank EIFs to 
legally constituted companies; and b) new issues of debt securities of 
legally constituted companies. Amount: Bs. 1,100 million (USD 160 
million).</p>
    <p>c) Fondo de Afianzamiento d elas Micro, Pequeñas y Medianas 
Empresas (FA-BDP): This fund is to guarantee credit operations to micro,
 small and medium-sized companies. Amount: Bs. 120 million (USD 17.5 
million).</p>
    <p>d) Fondo de garantía de vivienda social y solidaria (FOGAVISS): 
Its objective is to finance housing needs of lower-income sectors and 
boost the construction sector, within the framework of the social 
housing program. Amount: Bs. 5,000 million (USD 729 million).</p>
    <p>e) Portfolio securitization process: In order to grant a 
financing tool to financial entities, the procedures for the 
securitization of loan portfolios are enabled. The amount calculated is 
Bs. 8,000 million (USD 1,166).</p>

the banking system liquidity by about 50 percent. The authorities have 
also announced a 2-month moratorium on loan repayment (principal) in the
 financial system for natural persons and small companies. Most 
commercial banks have announced that they are suspending borrowers’ loan
 repayments for 2-4 months, with the delayed installments to be paid at

<h3>Bosnia and Herzegovina</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 5, 2020. In March, the government declared a state of 
emergency throughout the country, closed schools and universities, 
shuttered restaurants and shops, suspended public transportation, banned
 public gatherings, and imposed severe restrictions on the movement of 
people. Border are closed to non-BiH citizens. Incoming BiH citizens are
 quarantined for 14 days.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Both entities have ended 
their curfews for individuals of all ages. Most public events remain 
cancelled and public gatherings face limitations on total number of 
people present. Grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants, and cafes 
throughout the country are open, along with most other businesses.  
Restaurants and bars must close by 11:00pm. There are still social 
distance restrictions in place. Social distance restrictions include 
limitations on the number of people who can attend public gatherings and
 a requirement to wear masks indoors, on public transportation, and in 
public areas when social distancing is not possible. Sarajevo airport

<h3>Botswana</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Botswana recorded its first case on 
March 31. The government has declared a state of emergency, effective 
April 2, 2020, and has adopted a list of containment measures, including
 social distancing and travel bans. The government has lifted 
restrictions on May 22 after 7 weeks of lockdown. Since end-June, the 
country has recorded a resurgence of cases, resulting in a partial 
2-weeks lockdown limited to the capital starting July 30. On the 
economic front, diamond sales, and tourism and travel activities have 
fallen sharply, and lockdowns in neighboring countries could disrupt 
both regional supply and demand. The parliament has approved the 
mid-term review of NDP 11 including a 15 billion stimulus to support the
 recovery and facilitate structural transformation.</p>

<h3>Bosnia and Herzegovina</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 5, 2020. In March, the government declared a state of 
emergency throughout the country, closed schools and universities, 
shuttered restaurants and shops, suspended public transportation, banned
 public gatherings, and imposed severe restrictions on the movement of 
people. Border are closed to non-BiH citizens. Incoming BiH citizens are
 quarantined for 14 days.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Both entities have ended 
their curfews for individuals of all ages. Most public events remain 
cancelled and public gatherings face limitations on total number of 
people present. Restaurant and cafes throughout the country are open, 
along with most other businesses. There are still social distance 
restrictions in place. Grocery stores and pharmacies are open, and masks
 are required indoors. Masks or scarves are no longer required when 
social distancing measures can be observed. Masks should be worn inside 
and when social distancing is not possible. Sarajevo airport has 
reopened to passenger traffic.   BiH citizens and residents, and 
citizens of Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro may enter the country. 
Starting July 16, BiH borders are open for citizens and residents of EU 
and Schengen countries with a negative PCR test not older than 48 hours.
 For other non-resident foreign nationals, there is still an entry ban, 
though some with special circumstances (e.g. For a business meeting, to a
 funeral, for medical treatment, or in the company of a BiH-citizen 
spouse) may enter. Special documentation and/or a negative COVID test 
may be required.

    <p>At the meeting held on April 30, 2020, the Monetary Policy 
Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Botswana decided to reduce the Bank Rate 
by 50 basis points from 4.75 percent to 4.25 percent to support the

of Botswana relaxed rules to meet capital requirements and introduced 
measures to improve liquidity. Capital adequacy ratio for banks has been
 reduced from 15 to 12.5 percent, and regulatory forbearance for 
non-performing loans. Overnight funding costs were reduced, access to 
repo facilities broadened, and collateral constraints for bank borrowing
 from the BoB extended to include corporate bonds and traded stocks.</p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 10, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, the authorities announced a 
series of fiscal measures adding up to 12 percent of GDP, of which the 
direct impact in the 2020 primary deficit is estimated at 8.3 percent of
 GDP. Congress declared a state of “public calamity” on March 20, 
lifting the government’s obligation to comply with the primary balance 
target in 2020. The government has also invoked the escape clause of the
 constitutional expenditure ceiling to accommodate exceptional spending 
needs. Emergency measures are being included in a separate (so called 
‘war’) 2020 budget, not bound by the provisions of Brazil’s Fiscal 
Responsibility Law and the constitutional golden rule. The fiscal 
measures include temporary income support to vulnerable households (cash
 transfers to informal and low-income workers, bringing forward the 13th
 pension payment to retirees, expanding the Bolsa Familia program with 
the inclusion of over 1 million more beneficiaries, , and advance 
payments of salary bonuses to low income workers), employment support 
(partial compensation to workers which are temporarily suspended or have
 a cut in working hours, as well as temporary tax breaks), lower taxes 
and import levies on essential medical supplies, and new transfers from 
the federal to state governments to support higher health spending and 
as cushion against the expected fall in revenues. Financial assistance 
states and municipalities – with a temporary stay of debt payments– was 
also announced. Public banks are expanding credit lines for businesses 
and households, with a focus on supporting working capital (credit lines
 add up to 4.5 percent of GDP), and the government will back about 1 
percent of GDP in credit lines to SMEs and micro-businesses to cover 
payroll costs, working capital and investment.  </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The central bank lowered the policy rate (SELIC) by 225bps since 
mid-February, to the historical low of 2 percent. Measures to increase 
liquidity in the financial system (reduction of reserve requirements and
 capital conservation buffers, and a temporary relaxation of 
provisioning rules, among others) have been implemented. The reserve 
requirement has been reduced from 25 to 17, on top of a reduction of 6 
bps in early March, and the remuneration on reserve requirements on 
savings accounts was lowered to encourage lending. The central bank also
 opened a facility to provide loans to financial institutions backed by 
private corporate bonds as collateral, changed capital requirements for 
small financial institutions, and allowed banks to reduce provisions for
 contingent liabilities provided the funds are lent to SMEs. In 
addition, the Fed has arranged to provide up to US$60 billion to the 
central bank through a swap facility that will remain in place for the 
next six months. The five largest banks in the country agreed to 
consider requests by individuals and SMEs for a 60-day extension of 
their maturing debt liabilities.</p>

    <p>The exchange rate has depreciated by about 20 percent since 
mid-February and by 25 percent since end-2019. The central bank has 
intervened various times in the foreign exchange market since 
mid-February (both with spot and derivative contracts sales), by a total
 of 41 USD billion (about 12 percent of gross reserves). The central 
bank  resumed repo operations of Brazilian sovereign bonds denominated 
in US dollars, having released US$9 billion into the money market thus 
far.</p>

<h3>Brunei Darussalam</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong>. Brunei Darussalam reported its first 
confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 9, 2020. Since the outbreak, the 
authorities have prioritized policy measures to contain the pandemic, 
while rolling out economic relief packages to mitigate the impact on 
vulnerable sectors and support economic activities. Continuing 
testing/tracking of cases has enabled early isolation and treatment, 
with significant resources being channeled to the health sector. To meet
 the increasing needs of COVID-19 tests, an auxiliary virology 
laboratory has been constructed, which commenced operations on April 1. A
 contact-tracing app (“BruHealth”) has also been widely implemented, 
which is a necessary pre-condition for re-opening, in order to minimize 
the risk of a “second wave”.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy</strong>. Brunei started relaxing 
COVID-19 restrictions since May 16, in phases. In the initial phase, the
 plan was to gradually lift physical and social distancing measures for 
premises such as sports facilities, food courts and markets, while 
relaxing operating capacity of commercial premises (such as driving 
schools). With the pandemic under control, further de-escalation plans 
were implemented such as permitting mass gatherings of up to 350 people.
 Travel restrictions have also been eased. Brunei has established a 
reciprocal green lane with Singapore for short-term business and 
official trips effective September 1, marking the country’s first steps 
to re-establishing international travel. From September 15, foreigners 
are also allowed to enter Brunei for essential purposes and other 
considerations, subject to conditions. All inbound visitors will be 
required to undergo a minimum 2-14 days self-isolation period, depending
 on risk categories of the countries the travelers are from. </p>

food and medical supplies; and (iii) all bank fees and charges (except 
third party charges) that are related to trade and for payments of 
transactions in those Affected Sectors will be waived for a period of 
six months. To encourage social distancing and promote the usage of 
digital banking, online local interbank transfer fees and charges will 
be waived for a period of six months for all customers. Banks are also 
encouraged to review their lending rates in this current environment. </p>
    <p>•On March 30, the MOFE announced additional financial support

 (i) extends the deferment on principal payments of financing or loan to
 all sectors, (ii) provides for the restructuring or deferment on 
principal repayment of personal loans and hire purchase such as car 
financing, for a period not exceeding 10 years, (iii) provides for the

<h3>Bulgaria</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong>More than four months after the gradual 
reopening of the economy, daily new COVID-19 cases stay at substantially
 higher levels compared to the first wave of the pandemic, but the 
number of active cases has stabilized at a lower level than its peak in 
July. The extraordinary epidemic situation, which replaced the state of 
emergency introduced in mid-March, has been extended until November 30. 
During the first wave of the outbreak, the government initially 
implemented a range of containment measures, including social distancing
 and travel restrictions. As the emergency epidemic situation has been 
prolonged much more than initially anticipated, the government announced
 a new set of social and economic measures.</p>
<p>Preliminary data suggest a significant economic impact from the 
pandemic. According to the preliminary estimate, the Bulgarian economy 
shrank by 10.0 percent q/q in Q2-2020, after a 0.3 percent growth in the
 previous quarter. As of end-August, the registered unemployment rate is
 2.3 percentage points higher than at the start of the emergency 
situation in mid-March. Meanwhile, the budget remained in surplus 
cumulatively till July despite a large number of announced COVID-related
 policy measures. This partly reflects reprioritization of expenditures 
and delay in implementation of the measures.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy</strong>. The government has 
re-introduced mandatory mask wearing in response to increased number of 
cases, but maintained other relaxation measures, including the lifting 
of some travel restrictions, increased accessibility to open spaces and 
sport and recreation activities, reopening of open-air restaurants while
 securing minimum distance between tables, reopening of kindergartens 
and nurseries (but not schools), and reopening of shopping malls.</p>

been redesigned in order to increase access to the measure; ii) 
allocation of BGN 1,024 million to the state-owned company “The Fund of 
Funds” to provide subsidies to micro enterprises, self-employed, 
entrepreneurs from vulnerable groups, and eligible SMEs and companies; 
iii) allocation of BGN 800 million to a joint-initiative organization 
between the European Investment Fund and the European Commission to 
provide guarantee/credit to SMEs; and iv)  allocation of BGN 418 million
 to the Urban Development Funds, managed by the Fund of Funds, for 
long-term investment and working capital, targeting municipalities, PPPs
 and businesses, hit by the crisis, including tourism and transport.</p>

<h3>Burkina Faso</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 9, 2020. The government has adopted several 
containment measures, including social distancing, a nationwide curfew, 
closure of schools and universities, cancelation of major public events,
 closure of terrestrial borders, suspension of commercial flights, 
quarantine of the affected cities and the mandatory nationwide use of 
masks. The number of reported new daily positive cases of COVID-19 has 
broadly declined since late April.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The authorities began to 
ease some social and economic restrictions in late April with the 
reopening of some urban markets and venues of religious worship and 
suspension of quarantine of some cities. The reopening of passenger 
flights took place on August 1st accompanied by strict protocols for 
testing and quarantine for new arrivals. This gradual reopening is 
subject to continued social distancing guidelines and mandatory use of 
masks, among other measures. </p>

    <p>The Parliament on July 9, 2020 approved the revised 2020 budget 
which seeks to address the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19. Several 
measures have been taken and are contemplated under the revised budget, 
including: (i) lowering import duties and VAT for hygiene and healthcare
 goods and services critical to tackle COVID-19, and for tourism 
businesses; (ii) lowering other selected tax rates; (iii) delaying tax 
payments, and waiving late payment fines and penalties; (iv) suspending 
government fees charged on informal sector operators for rent, security 
and parking in urban markets; (v) lowering the licensing fee for 
companies in the transportation and tourism sectors; (vi) suspending 
on-site tax inspection operations; (vii) Donating food and providing 
assistance to households and local small businesses; (viii) supporting 
the water and electricity bills, including through cancelation, of the 
most vulnerable social groups; and (ix) securing adequate stocks of 
consumer products and strengthening surveillance of prices. An emergency
 response plan for the health sector has been prepared and expired in 
June. For the post-June period, a COVID-19 response plan has been 
prepared which includes both health-related measures and measures to 
support the social and economic recovery. The plan will be regularly 
updated to reflect local and global developments.</p>
    <p>On April 27, Heads of states of the West-Africa Economic and 
Monetary Union (WAEMU) declared a temporary suspension of the WAEMU 
growth and stability Pact setting six convergence criteria, including 
the 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit rule, to help member-countries cope 
with the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. This temporary suspension 
will allow member-countries to raise their overall fiscal deficit 
temporarily and use the additional external support provided by donors 
in response to the Covid-19 crisis. The Heads of States’ Declaration 
sets a clear expectation that fiscal consolidation will resume once the 
crisis is over.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic 
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks’ 
demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on
 economic activity. The BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a 
fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby 
allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25
 basis points lower than before the crisis. On June 22, the Monetary 
Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the
 monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO 
has also: (i) extended the collateral framework to access central bank 
refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private 
companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance 
institutions to accommodate demands from customers with Covid19-related 
repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period debt 
service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims 
as non performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of 
electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a 
special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for 
limited amounts of 3-month "Covid-19 T-Bills" to be issued by each WAEMU
 sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current 
pandemic. The amount of such special T-bills is equivalent to 0.8 
percent of GDP. Burkina Faso has been recently allowed to issue the 
equivalent of 0.5 percent of GDP of new 3-months Covid-19 T-Bills that 
banks may refinance with the BCEAO for their term to maturity at 2 
percent. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the 
five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basel II/III 
bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital 
adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 
9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead
 of 2022 initially planned.</p>

<h3>Burundi</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on April 1, 2020. The recent increase in the number of cases is
 the result of a large-scale testing campaign that the new government 
started on July 6, 2020. </p>
<p>Measures taken to minimize the risk of the pandemic breaking out in 
Burundi have been very limited: The population has been instructed to 
follow some basic rules of limited social distancing and frequent 
handwashing. Hand sanitizers and water for handwashing have been 
installed in public places. Travelers from high-risk countries are 
required to undergo quarantine, and commercial flights are still banned 
(cargo flights still operate). Borders remain closed, except for 
merchandise. The ban will be reviewed depending on how the pandemic 
evolves.</p>
<p>Burundi’s health care system is extremely weak. The authorities’ 
pandemic response plan aims to strengthen the health care system, the 
social safety net, and parts of the road network to facilitate access to
 sick people. To strengthen the health system, the authorities intend to
 intensify the communication on the risks of COVID-19 and enhance the 
screening capacity, the equipment of hospitals and health centers, and 
the stock of drugs. IMF staff estimates that the cost of the response 
plan will reach at least US$150 million (4.7 percent of GDP) 
cumulatively over 2020 and 2021. With the exception of the US$5 million 
from the World Bank, the authorities currently do not have cash buffers 
or credit sources that allow them to make these expenditures. They have 
already contacted and will continue to contact their development 
partners to request additional support for their pandemic response plan.</p>

<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>In addition to spending on the pandemic response plan, the 
authorities are considering providing support to hard-hit sectors such 
as the transport and hotel sectors. The cost of this plan will depend on
 the evolution of the pandemic, and they intend to meet it largely by 
reprioritizing the existing budget, with a rest to be financed (about 
US$12 million or 0.4 percent of GDP) over 2020 and 2021. </p>
    <p>Taxes owed will be forgiven for hotels and industries that will 
not be able to pay. Subsidies are planned to help pay salaries in these 
sectors and avoid massive layoffs. Salaries for suspended services such 
as those provided at the Melchior Ndadaye International Airport will 
continue to be paid with government support.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The authorities continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 
shock on loan performance as part of their efforts to protect financial 
stability. In particular, they are working with banks to encourage, on a
 targeted and time-bound basis, an extension of loan maturities to 
borrowers in hard-hit sectors, applying existing regulation in a 
flexible manner. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>No measure has been officially announced. Burundi has been 
engaged in multiple currency practices, with a parallel market exchange 
rate that is substantially more depreciated than the official exchange 
rate.  </p>

<h3>Cabo Verde</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 20, 2020. Prevention measures taken by the authorities
 include: installation of body temperature scans in airports, suspension
 of official travel and flights to China and other heavily affected 
countries, preparation of quarantine areas in hospitals, suspension of 
flights from European countries affected by COVID-19, the United States,
 Brazil, Senegal and Nigeria, as well as maritime traffic (with few 
exceptions), and quarantine of the island of Boa Vista where the 
community spread started inside a resort hotel . The authorities have 
also prepared a contingency plan and put in place a rapid response team.
 In late March, they declared the state of emergency, put in place 
social distancing measures, restricted travel between the nine inhabited
 islands, and put the country in lockdown for non-essential activities. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On May 29, the government 
lifted the State of Emergency for all islands. In line with it, the 
Prime Minister announced a deconfinement plan that includes : (i) 
resumption of inter-island air travel on July 15, (ii) resumption of 
maritime connections for passenger transport, originating and 
destinating to Boa Vista island on June 1 and to Santiago island on July
 15, (iv) restarting of cultural and sport events on October 1, (v) 
reopening of restaurants with regular hours on June 1, (vi) increased 
rapid tests in Praia’s laboratories, (vii) creation of an incentive 
framework to support companies to adapt their activity to the new 
requirements and standards of the deconfinement plan, and (viii) 
implementation of a digital platform for tracking positive cases of 
COVID-19.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The authorities have reprioritized spending through a revised 
budget, which is currently in parliament. In the meantime, they have 
taken measures to support the private sector, including loan guarantees 
and tax obligations facilities as follows: loan guarantees of up to 50 
percent for large companies in all sectors (CVE 1 billion, about €9 
million); up to 80 percent for companies in the tourism and transport 
sectors (CVE 1 billion); up to 100 percent for small-and medium-sized 
enterprises in all sectors (CVE 300 million, €2.7 million) and for 
micro-enterprises in all sectors (CVE 700 million CVE, about €6.7 
million). Other measures include faster settlement of invoices and VAT 
refunds, extension of the tax payment period, payment in installments 
for VAT and other withholding  taxes, cancellation of  contributions to 
the Pension Fund for three months, and funding of an emergency plan with
 CVE 76 million through the reallocation of budgetary appropriations, to
 cover additional expenses for personnel, training and medical 
equipment. </p>
    <p>For the most vulnerable, mitigating measures are estimated at CVE
 2.2 billion (1.2 percent of GDP). They comprise: (i) income 
compensation to provide financial support to individuals operating in 
the informal sector; (ii) social inclusion emergency measures for 
vulnerable people without income; (iii) social inclusion income, with 
support from the World Bank ; (iv) support to microfinance institutions 
to support interest-free loans to vulnerable households and; (v) care 
for the elderly with food assistance and other financial support.</p>

<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>In late March, the  central bank decided to loosen the monetary 
policy stance and to increase liquidity in the banking system.  Key 
measures included a reduction in rates as follows:  the policy rate by 
125 basis points to 0.25 percent, the minimum reserve requirements from 
13 to 10 percent, and the overnight deposit rate by 5 basis points to 
0.05 percent; and the setting up at the central bank of a long-term 
lending instrument for banks. The central bank (BCV) also called on 
banks to grant a moratorium on loans obligations to borrowers in good 
standing with their payment record as of end-March 2020. </p>
    <p>On April 1, the authorities introduced a moratorium on insurance 
payments and loans repayment during April-September 2020 for household, 
companies, and non-profit associations, as well as the SMEs. The 
moratorium on loan repayment has now been extended to December 31, 2020.
 </p>
    <p>The BCV also implemented prudential measures, including the 
reduction in capital adequacy ratio and provision for banks depending on
 requests by borrowers to place a moratorium or forbearance on loan 
repayment for three months.</p>

<h3>Cambodia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on January 27. There have been no deaths so far. All foreign 
arrivals into Cambodia need to obtain a visa at a Cambodian diplomatic 
mission abroad, a health certificate before departure to Cambodia, and a
 deposit of USD2000 (to cover potential health care costs). All arrivals
 are required to be tested and quarantined. Returning migrant workers 
are to self-isolate for 14 days. Domestic travel restrictions were 
lifted on 16 April. Massage parlors, sports arenas, fitness centers, and
 public transports have been closed since March. Public events and 
gathering (including religious gathering and concerts) have been banned.
 Since June, casinos, cinemas, museums and theatres have varyingly been 
reopened. Entertainment venues (e.g. karaoke and clubs) have been 
reopened as restaurants since July; schools have also been reopened in 
phases starting from September. The crisis has hit the Cambodian economy
 very hard during the first half of 2020, through exports of garments 
and textiles and tourism.  </p>

<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>A package worth USD 60 mn has been allocated for virus testing, 
containment, and treatment. Social assistance of nearly USD 400 mn is 
being implemented, including USD 300 mn for a new monthly cash transfer 
program for poor and vulnerable households (5-7 months from June 2020) 
and USD 100 mn cash for a work program. Measures to target poorer 
households are being scaled up with more frequent updates of IDPoor, 
especially because of the extent of informal work and returned migrant 
workers. USD 64 mn has been allocated for wage subsidies and skill 
training program for suspended workers/employees in the garments and 
tourism industries. Other spending has been rationalized, yielding 
savings of roughly USD 900 mn, of which around USD 500 mn will be from 
capital spending. Several tax relief measures, worth around USD 200 mn, 
have been introduced. The government has allocated USD 600 mn as special
 low-interest loans to specialized banks (USD 200 mn in Credit Guarantee
 Fund and USD 300 mn in Additional Financing Facility), in addition to 
packages issued to SMEs in manufacturing (USD 50mn) and SMEs in 
agricultural sector (USD 50mn). In August the government extended for 
two more months i) allowance subsidy for garment and tourism sectors; 
ii) tax exemption for tourism and aviation sector; and iii) cash relief 
program for poor and vulnerable families. </p>

    <p>The National Bank of Cambodia has implemented four measures to 
improve liquidity in the banking system: (i) delaying additional 
increases in the Capital Conservation Buffer; (ii) cutting the interest 
rate in its Liquidity Providing Collateralized Operations, decreasing 
banks’ funding costs in domestic currency; (iii) cutting the interest 
rate on Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (the collateral for LPCOs), 
to encourage banks to disburse loans; and (iv) lowering required 
reserves that banking and financial institutions must maintain at the 
National Bank of Cambodia both for local (riel) and foreign currencies. 
The Central Bank has also issued guidelines to financial institutions on
 loan restructuring for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
(but still performing) in priority sectors (tourism, garments, 
construction, transportation and logistics).</p>

<h3>Cameroon</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first cases were reported on March 
6. Cameroon continue to record daily increases in the number of 
COVID-19. The government announced a package of 13 containment measures 
on March 17, 2020 including closure of land, air and sea borders, 
quarantine for travelers returning from a country with a high level of 
infection, closure of schools and universities, prohibition of 
gatherings of more than 50 persons, closure of bars, restaurants and 
entertainment spots after 6 pm, suspension of missions of civil servants
 and parastatals abroad, cancellation of school and university games, 
and a ban on overloading taxis and public transportation. </p>
<p>Social distancing and sanitation measures include the use of 
electronic communications and digital tools for meetings of more than 10
 persons, compliance with hygiene measures recommended by the WHO such 
as systematic hand washing with soap and/or use of disinfectant hand gel
 in public offices, avoiding close contact such as shaking hands or 
hugging, and covering the nose when sneezing in public places. On April 
10, 2020, the government took seven additional measures to stop the 
spread of COVID-19. These measures took effect from April 13, 2020 and 
include wearing a mask in all areas open to the public, local production
 of drugs and screening tests, establishment of specialized COVID-19 
treatment centers in all regional capitals, intensification of screening
 and the awareness campaign, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On April 30, 2020 the 
government announced a set of reopening measures. The restriction 
prohibiting bars, restaurants and leisure facilities from operating 
after 6 p.m. was lifted, provided customers and users respect social 
distancing and wear protective masks. The limit on the number of 
passengers in public transportation vehicles (buses and taxi.) was also 
relaxed but masks remain compulsory and overloading is prohibited. 
Primary and secondary school students returned to school on June 1,

    <li>
    <p>On April 30, 2020, the president announced fiscal measures aimed 
at alleviating the adverse socio-economic impact of the crisis. A set of
 measures provide temporary tax accommodation to businesses directly 
affected by the crisis through tax moratoria and deferred payments, 
notably (i) exemptions from the tourist tax in the hotel and catering 
sectors for the rest of the 2020 financial year; (ii) exemption from the
 withholding tax for taxis and motorbikes and petty traders for the 
second quarter; (iii) the allocation of a special envelope of CFAF 25 
billion for the expedited clearance of VAT credits awaiting 
reimbursement, and (iv) the postponement of the deadline to pay land 
taxes for the 2020 financial year, to 30 September 2020.</p>
    <p>Other measures aim to alleviate the impact on households, in 
particular (i) an increase in the family allowance from CFAF 2,800 to 
CFAF 4,500; (ii) a raise of 20 percent for pensions that did not benefit
 from the 2016 reform; (iii) continued payment of family allowances from
 May to July to staff of companies which are unable to pay social 
security contributions or which have placed their staff on technical 
leave due to the crisis; (iv) spreading the payment of the social 
security contributions for the second quarter over three instalments and
 canceling late fees.</p>
    <p>Specific measures support the fight against the pandemic, notably
 (i) full income tax deductibility of donations and gifts made by 
companies for the fight against Covid-19, (ii) three-month suspension of
 the payment of parking and demurrage charges in the Douala and Kribi 
ports for essential goods; and (iii) the establishment of a 
MINFI-MINEPAT consultation framework aimed at mitigating the crisis and 
promoting a rapid resumption of activity.</p>
    <p>The authorities’ three-year preparedness and response plan 
presents a total financing cost close to US$ 825 million, of which about
 US$750 million have been identified or made available. It also includes
 tax relief to affected businesses estimated at about US$200 million.  
The plan includes five pillars, namely: (i) health strategy to prevent 
the spread of the pandemic and take care of infected persons (US$101 
million); (ii) mitigation of economic and financial repercussions of the
 pandemic (US$646 million); (iii) supply of essential products (US$9.5 
million); (iv) local development of innovative solutions (US$16.5 
million); and (v) social resilience to alleviate the repercussions of 
the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable people and households (US$52 
million).</p>
    <p>A special COVID-19 account, dedicated to financing the national 
response plan to the pandemic, has been created and is governed by a 
circular issued by the Minister of Finance. The circular specifies the 
modalities of organization, operation, and monitoring-evaluation 
mechanisms of the account. For 2020, the Revised Finance Law enacted in 
June 2020 allocates about US$310 million to the special COVID-19 account
 financed at 76 percent by resources released by debt service suspension
 and external budgetary support. </p>

    <p>On March 27, 2020, BEAC announced a set of monetary easing 
measures including a decrease of the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 
percent, a decrease of the Marginal Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5
 percent, a suspension of absorption operations, an increase of 
liquidity provision from FCFA 240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the 
range of private instruments accepted as collateral in monetary 
operations. The MPC also supported BEAC’s management’s intent to propose
 to reduce haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as 
collateral for refinancing operations, and to postpone by one-year 
principal repayment of consolidated central bank’s credits to member 
states, but these possible additional measures are not effective yet. 
Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities 
purchases for the next 6 months. The purchase program is meant as a 
safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances 
during the second half of 2020, while being consistent with BEAC Charter
 which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program will be based on
 revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the
 latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed 
under the IMF programs. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity 
injections with longer maturity, of up to one year.</p>
    <p>On March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use 
their capital conservation buffers of 2.5 percent to absorb 
pandemic-related losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive 
policy with regard to dividend distribution.</p>

<h3>Central African Republic</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first case has been identified in 
mid-March and the number of new cases has declined sharply over the last
 two months, owing in part to the discontinuation of widespread testing.
 To help contain the pandemic, the authorities adopted a response plan 
for the health sector and enacted social distancing measures, including 
the closing of borders, schools, and most public establishments, a ban 
on meetings of more than 15 people, and restrictions on the movement of 
people from Bangui. They have also been working on a more exhaustive 
plan, which, in addition to the strengthening of the health sector, 
would provide financial support to the most vulnerable households and 
companies.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the Economy.</strong> As the number of new cases
 has been declining, the president has announced some reopening measures
 to enable the restart of the economic activity. Restaurants, bars and 
places of worship have been allowed to re-open. Moreover, international 
travels have resumed gradually, and most travel restrictions have been 
lifted, and the quarantine for people arriving from abroad has been 
reduced from 21 to 14 days. This reopening is conditional on following 
some measures such as frequent hand washing and social distancing. 
However, self-quarantine for confirmed cases remain in place..</p>

    <li>
    <p>The response plan for the health sector was prepared in strong 
collaboration with the WHO, with an estimated cost of 27 billion of FCFA
 (1.9 percent of GDP). It goes beyond an immediate response plan and 
contains measures to strengthen the ability of the healthcare system to 
deal with such pandemics in the future. It notably aims at: (i) 
providing medical care of confirmed cases, (ii) improving the monitoring
 of the country’s points of entry; and (iii) strengthening the 
capacities of the medical staff, laboratories and hospitals. In addition
 to the health sector plan, the authorities are envisaging providing 
financial support to the most vulnerable households and companies, while
 increasing access to water. Other specific fiscal measures to help the 
private sector, such as tax relief or suspension and easing of public 
procurement procedures, are also being considered. The government has 
requested the help of its development partners to finance this plan, 
through grants and loans. A draft supplementary budget law has been 
adopted and includes around 44 billion of CFAF of donors additional 
support related to Covid-19. The additional spending related to Covid-19
 amounts for about 15 billion of CFAF, mainly broken down as 12 billion 
for prevention and management of the pandemic, 0.5 billion as support to
 vulnerable household and 2.6 billion for the support to the private 
sector.</p>

<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On March 27, 2020, BEAC announced a set of monetary easing 
measures including a decrease of the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 
percent, a decrease of the Marginal Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5
 percent, a suspension of absorption operations, an increase of 
liquidity provision from FCFA 240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the 
range of private instruments accepted as collateral in monetary 
operations. The MPC also supported BEAC’s management’s intent to propose
 to reduce haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as 
collateral for refinancing operations, and to postpone by one-year 
principal repayment of consolidated central bank’s credits to member 
states, but these possible additional measures are not effective yet. 
Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities 
purchases for the next 6 months. The purchase program is meant as a 
safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances 
during the second half of 2020, while being consistent with BEAC Charter
 which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program will be based on
 revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the
 latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed 
under the IMF programs. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity 
injections with longer maturity, of up to one year.</p>
    <p>On March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use 
their capital conservation buffers of 2.5% to absorb pandemic-related 
losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive policy with regard to 
dividend distribution. </p>

<h3>Chad</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 19. The number of cases, contained until August, 
increased substantially in September. . Chadian authorities have adopted
 containment measures, including passenger flight suspension, closure of
 borders with CAR and Sudan, quarantine for nationals returning from 
high risk countries, closure of shops and stores (excluding basic 
goods), shortened banking working hours, cancellation of events and 
gatherings of more than 50 people, closure of worship places as well as 
schools and universities. This comes in addition to an inter-ministerial
 management committee meets daily to monitor developments, as well as 
the establishment of hygiene regulations in all public places. A 
hospital in N’Djamena was designated to receive infected cases and 
measures are being taken to strengthen laboratory capacities to increase
 testing. The curfew (11PM-05AM) was extended for an additional two 
weeks starting from September 14. Additionally, the state of medical 
emergency was extended for three months starting from July 17, giving 
more execution power to anti COVID-19 measures. The authorities have 
also limited travel from and into N’Djamena since May 8. Additionally, 
wearing a face mask became mandatory in public places starting May 7. 
</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On May 18, the health 
crisis management committee decided to relax some of the containment 
measures, including reopening of: (i) restaurants and grills; (ii) 
stores, shops and markets. Urban public transportation resumed subject 
to a maximum number of passengers (4 for taxis and 10 for minibuses). On
 June 25: (i) classes resumed partially for elementary, middle and high 
schools, as well as universities and (ii) worship places reopened. 
Additionally, the temporary removal of restrictions on inter-urban 
transport was extended. Travel flights resumed on August 1st at 
N’Djamena airport, with four carriers (Air France, Ethiopian Airlines, 
Turkish Airlines and EgyptAir).</p>

 training of medical and technical staff, (ii) purchase of necessary 
medical equipment, (iii) construction of seven health centers in remote 
areas, (iv) construction of three mobile hospitals, and (v) securely 
managing entry points. Additionally, the capacity of Farcha Hospital in 
N'Djamena is going to be expanded and the hiring of additional health 
workers is in process. The authorities have also decided on a package of
 fiscal measures to help businesses weather the shock: (i) for SMEs, the
 authorities will, among other things, reduce by 50 percent the business
 license fees and the presumptive tax for 2020, (ii) tax breaks such as 
carryforward losses and delays in tax payments will also be examined on a
 case-by-case basis, (iii) clearance of domestic arears of about CFAF 
110 billion owed to suppliers, (iv) a subsidy planned to the 
agricultural sector (0.3 percent of non-oil GDP), and (v) the 
simplification of the import process for food and necessity items, 
including health equipment, and tax exemptions for these items.  
Measures were also taken to alleviate the hardship on households, 
including (i) temporary suspension of payments of electricity and water 
bills for the lifeline consumption, as well as (ii) Replenishment of the
 national food distribution program (Office National de Sécurité 
Alimentaire, ONASA) (0.5 percent of non-oil GDP), (iii) the National

<h3>The Kingdom of the Netherlands—Curaçao</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> As of September 24, Curaçao has 199 
active cases. From the beginning of the pandemic, the authorities 
reported 315 positive cases and 1 death. Following the first case on 
March 13, Prime Minister Rhuggenaath declared the state of emergency and
 announced travel restrictions, quickly followed by a border closure. As
 the number of cases increased, the government introduced a curfew on 
March 28 followed by a full lockdown on March 30.  </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>Since June 15, the 
authorities have gradually reopened the borders to international travel 
by allowing travel from several low-risk countries in the Caribbean. On 
July 1, the authorities opened the borders to the Netherlands, Belgium, 
Canada, China, France, Italy, Spain and Germany—designated as 
medium-risk countries—with a maximum of 10 thousand visitors so that 
there will be minimal pressure on the local health system. A negative 
COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival is required for entry
 to Curaçao. Travelers from medium-risk countries are allowed to travel 
to Curaçao without having to quarantine, provided they meet certain 
conditions, including undergoing a PCR test, which must return a 
negative result. Both low-risk and medium-risk lists are periodically 
updated. As of September 2,  the low-risk list comprised 22 countries 
and territories in the Caribbean, including  Bermuda, Barbados, Bonaire,
 Cayman Islands, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, Jamaica, Trinidad
 and Tobago; and the medium-risk list comprised 23 countries including 
Canada, China, Cuba, Guyana, 13 EU countries, New Zealand, Taiwan, 
Turkey, Turks and Caicos, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. All other 
countries are considered high-risk and travelers from these countries 
must request permissions to enter Curaçao and are subject to 2-week 
mandatory quarantine. Following a sharp increase of new coronavirus 
cases since late August, Curaçao reintroduced several measures on 
September 14 for a period of 3 weeks. To protect the most vulnerable and
 reduce pressures on health care facilities and public order, the 
government imposed a curfew banning people from the streets after 11 pm 
until 5 am. Agglomeration in public palaces of more than 4 people was 
also banned and restaurants and bars can only stay open until 10 pm.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The first package (Alivio 1) was introduced in March. It included
 tax measures of NAf 33 and some first-response spending. The second, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fondodisosten.org/" target="_blank">more comprehensive package</a>
 (Alivio 2) elaborated the following assistance programs: (i) payroll 
subsidies to support employment in the private sector up to 80 percent 
of pre-crisis wages conditional on the revenue loss; (ii) support for 
the self-employed (NA<em>f</em> 1,335 per person per month); (iii) job loss benefits (NA<em>f</em>
 1,000 per person per month) for workers laid off since mid-March 2020; 
(iv) additional benefits for welfare recipients; (v) credit facilities 
for SMEs, and (vi) compensation of premium losses for the Social 
Security Bank. The Netherlands provided financing of NAf 381 million (8½
 percent of GDP) to support Alivio 2 in the second quarter. Given 
available financing, measures implemented in the second quarter included
 the payroll subsidies (with the maximum coverage reduced from 80 to 60 
percent), support for the self-employed, job loss benefits and food 
vouchers. Financing for the third quarter is being discussed.  The total
 spending under Alivio 2 in 2020 will be determined by available 
financing.</p>

    <p>On March 20, 2020, the Centrale Bank van Curaçao en Sint Maarten 
(CBCS) reduced the pledging rate--at which the commercial banks can 
borrow from the CBCS--by 150 basis points to 1 percent and suspended the
 200 basis points surcharge on the pledging rate on loans exceeding NAf 
20 million. Furthermore, the CBCS reintroduced the overdraft facility 
for commercial banks. The CBCS also announced that it would lower the 
interest rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) to ease the money market
 by absorbing less liquidity.</p>
    <p>On March 20, 2020, the CBCS (i) allowed commercial banks and 
credit institutions to provide a 3 to 6-month payment moratorium on 
interest and principal of all outstanding loans, without having to make 
an adequate provision, (ii) announced that commercial banks might exceed
 the debt service ratio (37 percent), to a maximum of 50 percent, and 
(iii) allowed life insurance companies and pension funds to provide 
clients a 3 to 6-month payment moratorium on policy premiums without 
having to make an adequate provision.</p>

<h3>China, People's Republic of</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> On early January 2020, Chinese 
authorities determined that a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan was caused by a
 novel coronavirus. The government imposed strict containment measures, 
including the extension of the national Lunar New Year holiday, the 
lockdown of Hubei province, large-scale mobility restrictions at the 
national level, social distancing, and a 14-day quarantine period for 
returning migrant workers. Reflecting these containment measures, the 
economy contracted by 6.8 percent (yoy) in Q1.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Starting in mid-February, 
the government has gradually removed mobility and activity restrictions,
 prioritizing essential sectors, specific industries, regions, and 
population groups based on ongoing risk assessments. Most businesses and
 schools have reopened nationwide, but social distancing rules remain in
 place at the micro level and foreign entry remains restricted to 
contain imported cases. Localized movement restrictions were re-imposed 
in new hotspots, including in the northeastern Jilin and Heilongjiang 
province, and more recently in Beijing, Xinjiang, and Dalian. As of 
August 27, all these regions (except certain areas in Xinjiang) have 
lowered their emergency response level to Level III (low risk). Testing 
and individualized health QR codes are used to gauge the path of the 
virus and contain outbreaks. With normalizing economic activity, real 
GDP growth rebounded by 3.2 percent (yoy) in Q2.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>An estimated RMB 4.6 trillion (or 4.5 percent of GDP) of 
discretionary fiscal measures have been announced. Key measures include:
 (i) increased spending on epidemic prevention and control, (ii) 
production of medical equipment, (iii) accelerated disbursement of 
unemployment insurance and extension to migrant workers, (iv) tax relief
 and waived social security contributions, and (v) public investment. 
The overall public sector expansion is expected to be significantly 
higher, reflecting the effect of improvements of the national public 
health emergency management system, additional support through 
state-owned enterprises, and automatic stabilizers.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The PBC provided monetary policy support and acted to safeguard 
financial market stability. Key measures include: (i) liquidity 
injection into the banking system via open market operations (reverse 
repos and medium-term lending facilities), (ii) expansion of re-lending 
and re-discounting facilities by RMB 1.8 trillion to support 
manufacturers of medical supplies and daily necessities, micro-, small- 
and medium-sized firms and the agricultural sector (of which 0.8 
trillion was phased out at end-June) and reduction of their interest 
rates by 50 bps (re-lending facilities) and 25 bps (re-discounting 
facility), (iii) reduction of the 7-day and 14-day reverse repo rates by
 30 bps, as well as the 1-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) rate 
and targeted MLF rate by 30 and 20 bps, respectively, (iv) targeted RRR 
cuts by 50-100 bps for large- and medium-sized banks that meet inclusive
 financing criteria which benefit micro- and small-sized enterprises 
(MSEs), an additional 100 bps for eligible joint-stock banks, and 100 
bps for small- and medium-sized banks to support SMEs, (v) reduction of 
the interest on excess reserves from 72 to 35 bps, (vi) expansion of 
policy banks’ credit line to private firms and MSEs (RMB 350 billion), 
and (vii) introduction of new instruments to support lending to MSEs, 
including a zero-interest “funding-for-lending” scheme (RMB 400 billion)
 to finance 40 percent of local banks’ new unsecured loans and 
incentivizing them to further extend payment holidays for eligible loans
 by subsidizing 1 percent of loan principles (RMB 40 billion).</p>
    <p>The government has also taken multiple steps to limit tightening 
in financial conditions, including measured forbearance to provide 
financial relief to affected households, corporates, and regions facing 
repayment difficulties. Key measures include (i) encouraging lending to 
SMEs, including supporting uncollateralized SME loans from local banks, 
raising the target for large banks’ lending growth to MSEs from 30 
percent to 40 percent, and establishing an evaluation system for banks’ 
lending to MSEs, (ii) delay of loan payments, with the deadline extended
 to the end of March 2021, and eased loan size restrictions for online 
loans, and other credit support measures for eligible SMEs and 
households, (iii) tolerance for higher NPLs and reduced NPL provision 
coverage requirements, (iv) support bond issuance by financial 
institutions to finance SME lending, (v) additional financing support 
for corporates via increased bond issuance by corporates, including 
relaxing rules on insurers for bond investments, (vi) increased fiscal 
support for credit guarantees, (vii) flexibility in the implementation 
of the asset management reform, and (vii) easing of housing policies by 
local governments.  </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The exchange rate has been allowed to adjust flexibly. A ceiling 
on cross-border financing under the macroprudential assessment framework
 was raised by 25 percent for banks, non-banks and enterprises. 
Restrictions on the investment quota of foreign institutional investors 
(QFII and RQFII) were removed. </p>

<h3>Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Hong Kong SAR reported its first 
confirmed COVID-19 case on January 23, 2020. Various containment 
measures remain in place, including (i) requiring mask-wearing in all 
public places including on public transport with certain exemptions, 
(ii) prohibiting public gathering of more than 4 people, (iii) reducing 
the seating capacity in restaurants by 50 percent, (iv) implementing a 
temporary entry ban on Hong Kong SAR non-resident from overseas 
countries, (v) reducing and partially suspending cross-border transport 
and border control point services, (vi) imposing a 14-day compulsory 
quarantine for travelers from overseas and Mainland China, (vii) 
requiring passengers flying from “high-risk” countries to have negative 
COVID-19 testing results before arriving in Hong Kong SAR, and (viii) 
tightening exemption arrangements for air and sea crews. The government 
provided one-off virus testing services to all citizens on voluntary 
basis during September 1-14, with about 1.8 million people participating
 in the testing exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> As the COVID-19 situation 
has improved since late August, some social distancing measures have 
been gradually relaxed: (i) allowing removal of face mask for outdoor

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>An estimated HK$311.5 billion (or about 11 percent of GDP) of 
fiscal measures have been announced and are being implemented. Key 
measures include (i)  enhancing anti-epidemic facilities and services 
(HK$43 billion or 1.5 percent of GDP) including the establishment of a 
new Anti-Epidemic Fund, (ii) tax and fee reliefs and other one-off 
relief measures (HK$85.5 billion or 3.0 percent of GDP), (iii) cash 
payout to Hong Kong SAR permanent residents aged 18 or above (HK$71 
billion or 2.5 percent of GDP), (iv) employment subsidy scheme (HK$80 
billion or 2.8 percent of GDP), (v) sector-specific relief measures 
(HK$25.5 billion or 0.9 percent of GDP), and (vi) temporary job creation
 (HK$6 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP).</p>
    </li>

<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Under the currency board arrangement, the Base Rate was adjusted 
downward to 1.50 and 0.86 percent on March 4 and March 16, respectively,
 according to a pre-set formula, following the downward shifts in the 
target range for the US federal funds rate. The jurisdictional 
countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong SAR was reduced further 
from 2.0 to 1.0 percent on March 16 and the level of regulatory reserves
 was cut by half in April to increase banks' lending capacity. The Hong 
Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also introduced measures to increase 
banking sector’s liquidity, including a temporary US Dollar Liquidity 
Facility (US$10 billion) which uses funds obtained through the US Fed's 
FIMA Repo Facility, encouraging banks to deploy their liquidity buffers 
more flexibly, and easing interbank funding conditions by reducing the 
issuance size of Exchange Fund Bills. The implementation of the various 
requirements under the Basel III framework will also be deferred. The 
HKMA also eased countercyclical macroprudential measures for mortgage 
loans on non-residential properties by raising the LTV cap to 50 percent
 from 40 percent for general cases, effective on August 20.</p>
    <p>Key measures to provide financial relief include (i) the 
introduction of low-interest loans for SMEs with 100 percent government 
guarantee (HK$70 billion), (ii) enhancing the 80- and 90-percent 
government guarantee products by raising the maximum loan amount and 
extending the eligibility coverage to listed firms, (iii) pre-approved 
principal payment holiday for corporates, and (iv) other measures by 
banks to the extent permitted by their risk management principles, 
including delay of loan payment, extension of loan tenors, and principal
 moratoriums for affected SMEs, sectors, and households as appropriate. </p>

<h3>Colombia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Colombia confirmed its first COVID-19 
case on March 6, 2020. The government declared a state of emergency on 
March 17, and a quarantine beganon March 25.   On August 25 the end of 
the quarantine was announced effective September 1st with some 
restrictions (consistent with the extension of the health emergency) 
including gatherings of more than 50 individuals, the operation of bars 
and land and sea borders will remain close. Limited international air 
travel resumed on September 19th.  </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The construction and 
manufacturing sectors were allowed to restart operations on April 27, 
and an expanded list of industrial and commercial services sectors 
restarted on May 11. Other services, including selected retail segments,
 were allowed to reopen on June 1st, although local jurisdictions 
(including Bogota) have been slower to ease restrictions. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>A state of emergency decree created a National Emergency 
Mitigation Fund, which will be partially funded from regional and 
stabilization funds (around 1.5 percent of GDP) and will be complemented
 by 1.3 percent of GDP from domestic bond issuance and other budgetary 
resources. The Fiscal Rule Consultative Committee had allowed a 2020 
fiscal deficit of 6.1 percent given the expected economic impact, but on
 June 15 allowed the government to temporarily suspend the fiscal rule 
in 2020 and 2021. The government now projects headline deficits of 8.2 
and 5.1 percent of GDP for 2020 and 2021 respectively. Additional 
budgetary support for health has been announced including part payment 
for Covid-19 tests, along with faster direct contracting for services 
associated with the emergency response and payments to health providers 
for ICU availability, new credit lines providing liquidity support to 
the coffee sector, the education sector, public transportation sector, 
health and public sector providers and all tourism-related companies, 
new credit lines for payroll and loan payments for SMES, for working 
capital for large corporates, and for corporates in the sectors most 
affected by the pandemic trough the National Guarantee Fund, a two-month
 suspension of pension contributions by both employees and employers, 
delayed tax collection, an exemption of tariffs and VAT for strategic 
health imports and selected food industries and services, delayed 
utility payments for poor and middle income households, expanded 
transfers for vulnerable groups, and additional benefits for recently 
unemployed workers. In addition, the government announced a payroll 
subsidy equivalent to 50 percent of the minimum wage per worker for 
businesses with a fall of over 20 percent in revenues for a period of 
three months. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Central Bank has cut the policy rate by 225 bp and has 
implemented several measures to boost liquidity in both domestic and 
foreign currency. These include: (i) an expansion of their liquidity 
overnight and term facilities in terms of amounts, applicable securities
 and eligible counterparts, (ii) purchase of debt issued by credit 
institutions, and (iii) TES purchases in the secondary market. The 
Central Bank also lowered the reserve requirement applicable to savings 
and checking accounts from 11 to 8 percent and the one applicable to 
fixed-term savings accounts (less than 18 months) from 4.5 to 3.5 
percent.</p>
    <p>Superfinanciera has allowed supervised entities to reprofile all 
loans that were less than 30 days over-due on Feb 29. These new 
provisions can include grace periods or extended deadlines. Banks cannot
 increase interest rates on loans, charge interest on interest, or 
report entities to credit registries for availing themselves of any 
forbearance measures. Countercyclical provisions have been released, and
 Superfinanciera has authorized certain related-party transactions for 
fund managers, including the purchase of Certificados de Deposito a 
Termino (term deposit certificates) issued by an associated entity. Fund
 managers can also invest, directly or indirectly up to 15 per cent of 
the value of each fund, in other investment funds managed by them.</p>

    <p>To provide liquidity in FX markets, the central bank has 
auctioned FX swaps (in US dollars), but suspended this program on June 
30 due to vacant auctions. In addition, a new mechanism of exchange-rate
 hedging was introduced through auctions of Non-Deliverable Forwards 
with a 30-day maturity. Colombia also obtained access to the FIMA Repo 
facility and the Flexible Credit Line arrangement with the IMF was 
renewed for two years on May 1st.</p>

<h3>Comoros</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The pandemic in Comoros has not turned 
into a deep health crisis and only seven deaths have been officially 
reported since the first case was reported on May 1. The COVID-19 shock 
comes less than a year after Cyclone Kenneth, which necessitated 
emergency Fund financial support. Remittances through exchange houses 
increased during the last two months. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The economy has gradually 
started to open. Air travel is scheduled to restart this month. Schools 
and religious ceremonies have already opened. The authorities have 
prepared a public-health related plan that describes the measures to be 
taken to minimize risks from pandemics. Implementation of the plan 
appears to be proceeding slowly, however, reflecting the authorities’ 
severe financial and capacity constraints. The WHO ranks the health 
system’s preparedness at the lowest level in international comparison.  </p>

<h3>Congo, Democratic Republic of</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The Democratic Republic of Congo 
declared its first case of COVID-19 on March 10, and the virus continues
 to spread across the country with thousands of confirmed cases and 
hundreds of deaths. On March 24th, the government declared a state of 
emergency and imposed the confinement of the capital, Kinshasa, which 
includes restrictions to travel between Kinshasa and the rest of the 
country and the prohibition of all gatherings of people in public 
spaces. Passenger flights from abroad are not allowed and border posts 
are closed to non-cargo shipments. These measures add to previous 
restrictions, such as closure of all education centers, suspension of 
all religious and sporting events, and closure of bars and restaurants. 
In 2020, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are projected to reduce 
real GDP growth (including through lower mining activity), increase 
consumer prices (particularly of imported products), reduce fiscal 
revenue (both mining and non-mining), and increase fiscal spending 
through the implementation of a COVID-19 response plan, which includes 
the opening of new COVID-19 test centers in Lubumbashi and other cities.
 In late June, the government announced the deconfinement of the Gombe 
business district in Kinshasa and the gradual deconfinement of workers 
in mining sites. Also, a new 9-month multi sectoral response plan 
against the pandemics (PMUAIC-19) was officially launched in June. The 
plan includes actions to strengthen the health system, stabilize the 
economy, and reinforce security and social protection.</p>

    <p>A preparedness and response national plan to deal with the 
pandemic has been designed with support from development partners, and 
it is coordinated by Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe. The plan mainly focuses 
on actions to (i) strengthen early detection and surveillance and foster
 technical and operational coordination within the government; (ii) 
improve the quality of medical care to infected patients; and (iii) 
develop effective preventive communication strategies and enhance 
medical logistic platforms. The plan’s budget is estimated at US$135 
million (0.3 percent of GDP). </p>
    <p>The following measures were approved the week of April 12th by 
the Prime Minister:i) a three-month VAT exemption on pharmaceutical 
products and basic goods, ii) suspension of tax audits for companies, 
iii) a grace period for businesses on tax arrears, iv) full tax 
deductibility of any donations made to the COVID relief fund. The week 
of April 19, an additional set of measures were adopted, namely: i) 
provision of water and electricity for a period of two months, free of 
charge, ii) prohibition to evict renters in case of no payment of 
financial obligations from March to June 2020, iii) suspension of VAT 
collection on the production and on the sales of basic goods.</p>
    <p>In the context of sustained increases in inflation and exchange 
rate depreciation, on August 18 the central bank (BCC), the Ministry of 
Finance, and the Ministry of Budget formally signed a Stability Pact, 
which sets a number of policy and operational commitments by those 
institutions that would contribute to maintaining “macroeconomic 
stability, as a prerequisite for strong and sustained growth”.</p>

local currency; and (iii) creating a new collateralized long-term 
funding facility for commercial banks of up to 24 months to support the 
provision of new credit for the import and production of food and other 
basic goods. The BCC has also postponed the adoption of new minimum 
capital requirements and encouraged the restructuring of non-performing 
loans. In addition, the BCC announced measures to reduce contamination 
risks in bank notes and promote the use of e-payments. </p>

<h3>Congo, Republic of</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Congo, as most of oil producers, is 
being hit by two shocks—the potential spread of COVID-19 and the sharp 
decline in oil prices. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on
 March 15, 2020. The authorities’ policy is responding to these 
developments. As of September 24, there are about 5005 cumulative cases,
 with a fatality rate of about 2 percent. The Ministry of Health has 
prepared a national contingency plan in collaboration with WHO and other
 international partners. In the meantime, the authorities started to 
adopt containment measures, including social distancing, travel bans on 
visitors from high-risk countries and quarantine for 
nationals/expatriates returning from those countries, screening at ports
 of entry, and school closures. A lock-down was established in the 
country from April 1 to mid-May, and extended through end July but with a
 reduced time interval of 10PM to 5AM. In late July, in response to the 
surge in cases, the authorities have increased the time interval for the
 lockdown to 8PM-5AM in the two major cities of Brazzaville and Pointe 
Noir.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On May 18, the lockdown 
was eased with opening up of public transportation, primary schools 
final year class and graduation class. As of late June, restaurants, 
hotels, and most private services have opened in the two main cities, 
while the rest of the country had opened up completely previously. Since
 May 30, a large scale screening for teachers and administrative staff 
has been occurring. The flight space reopened fully as of August 24 with
 the requirement that each arrival is equipped with a negative covid19 
test result dating from at most 3 days. The official school opening date
 on campus is set for February 1, 2021 with virtual learning taking 
place up to that point.</p>

    <p>The overall cost of the response plan to the COVID 19 epidemic 
has been estimated at US$170 million (100 billion XAF), equivalent to 
1.6 percent of 2020 GDP, to date the government has made available to 
the Ministry of Health the amount of US$1.4 million. The EU, WFP, France
 are getting together to provide support for the poorest segments of the
 population with combined support amounting to about 3 billion XAF as of
 now. Other UN agencies have provided about $8 million to support 
covid19 efforts.</p>
    <p>The government has adopted some measures to ease tax and duty 
payments for private enterprises. In particular, more time has been 
given to companies to pay their taxes and tax assessments on site have 
been abandoned. The import duty directorate is also strongly encouraging
 electronic payment of dues and allowing more electronic documents to be
 accepted at the port. Corporate income tax has been reduced to 28 
percent from 30 percent and the turnover tax has been reduced to 5 
percent from 7 percent for small businesses with turnover below 100 
million XAF.

    a set of monetary easing measures including a decrease of the
    policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 percent, a decrease of the Marginal
    Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5 percent, a suspension of
    absorption operations, an increase of liquidity provision from FCFA
    240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the range of private
    instruments accepted as collateral in monetary operations. The MPC
    also supported BEAC’s management’s intent to propose to reduce
    haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as collateral
    for refinancing operations, and to postpone by one-year principal
    repayment of consolidated central bank’s credits to member states, 
but these possible additional measures are not effective yet. Further, 
at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) 
meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities 
purchases for the next 6 months. The purchase program is meant as a 
safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances 
during the second half of 2020, while being consistent with BEAC Charter
 which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program will be based on
 revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the
 latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed 
under the IMF programs. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity 
injections with longer maturity, of up to one year.</p>
    <p>On
    March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use their
    capital conservation buffers of 2.5% to absorb pandemic-related
    losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive policy with
    regard to dividend distribution. Discussions are taking place at
    the country level on whether private companies can have access to
    the 100 billion XAF fund set up by the President and on simplifying
    access to refinancing instruments. A guarantee scheme has been set
    up to help private companies service their banking debts, but no
    details have been provided on the amounts or conditions.

<h3>Costa Rica</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Costa Rica reported its first confirmed 
case of COVID-19 on Mar 6, and as of August 26, the country has 
registered 36,307 confirmed cases and 386 deaths. In response, the 
government has implemented a range of measures to contain the spread of 
coronavirus, including declaration of a state of yellow alert and a 
national emergency, restrictions and bans on non-essential private and 
public vehicle circulation, international travel restrictions, mandatory
 quarantines for close contacts and those who enter the country, 
closures of schools, churches, beaches, national parks, bars, clubs and 
casinos, entry restrictions for foreign truck drivers, increased 
testing, and the conversion of a rehabilitation center into a hospital 
specializing in COVID-19 treatment. 2020Q1 GDP grew by 0.5 percent y/y. A
 monthly indicator of economic activity so far points to 2020H1 growth 
of around -4 percent y/y.
</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Costa Rica began easing 
some coronavirus measures starting May 1. Theaters, gyms and athletic 
centers will be permitted to reopen during the week but with limited 
capacity and under strict rules (cleaning, distances etc.). The Health 
Ministry announced a further loosening of restrictions, to be 
implemented in four phases over 80 days. The first phase started on May 
16 when some national parks and hotels re-opened at limited capacity and
 contact sports were permitted without spectators, among other easing 
measures. The second phases began on June 1 when restaurants, gyms, 
museums, and remaining hotels re-opened at 50 percent capacity. Phase 3 
started on June 26 with extended hours for shops, cinemas, museums, 
theaters, and beaches. Houses of worship could open at limited capacity 
and under social distancing rules. The authorities subsequently slowed 
down the reopening of the economy in districts that have a high number 
of new infections and reintroduced localized vehicle circulation 
restrictions and business closures. Since August 31, restrictions have 
been relaxed further in the entire country, with a focus on increasing 
economic activity. Restrictions were further relaxed starting September 
9, when hotels could operate at 100 percent capacity, among other 
measures. The border opened to international tourists from countries 
that have controlled the pandemic on August 1. </p>

moratorium on taxes to be paid to the Costa Rican Tourism Institute for 
firms in the tourism sector facing liquidity constraints; (iiv) a 
monthly subsidy of ¢100-200,000 for 3 months to about 375 thousand 
households economically affected by the crisis. In addition, salary 
increases for public employees (except for the police) are suspended 
this year to direct more resources to the attention of COVID-19. In 
addition, the government announced public investment of 3.1 billion 
colones over 2020-2021 (out of which 1.1 billion colones are for PPPs).</p>

    <p>The Central Bank cut its policy rate by a full percentage point 
to a record low of 0.75 percent to soften the economic damage caused by 
the pandemic and to improve credit conditions for households and 
businesses. In addition, the Central Bank started purchasing government 
securities (issued pre-2020, in Costa Rican colones, and with a maximum 
maturity of 10 years) in the secondary market to provide liquidity 
during market distress. Further measures that aim at protecting workers 
and companies include (i) reducing the cost of credit (including through
 ¢900,000 million loans at preferential interest rates to firms across 
all sectors from state-owned banks); (ii) relaxed regulations on 
restructuring of loans and on buybacks; (iii) a minimum 2-month 
moratorium on the payment of principal and/or interest for personal 
credit, mortgages, auto loans, credit card loans, consumer loans, and 
education loans for affected households and firms (the National Bank of 
Costa Rica announced it would extend moratoria for affected clients 
until December 2020); (iv) a temporary reduction in the minimum 
accumulation of countercyclical provisions for financial entities to 
zero; (v) the temporary suspension of provisioning rules for financial 
entities that record losses for at least 6 out of 12 months; (vi) 
authorization for complementary pension operators to provide partial 
funds to employees affected by COVID-19; and (vii) ¢700,000 million 
medium-term swap facilities that the Central Bank is offering to 
financial intermediates. </p>

<h3>Côte d’Ivoire</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed case was reported on
 March 12, 2020. The authorities swiftly adopted containment measures 
including (i) declaring a state of emergency and establishing a curfew 
from 9pm to 5am; (ii) banning all international travels, except for 
humanitarian aid purpose; (iii) prohibiting public gatherings of more 
than 50 people; (iv) closing schools, nightclubs, restaurants, bars, 
theatres and other recreational facilities; and imposing restrictions on
 public transportation and movements between regions in the country; (v)
 making wearing masks mandatory and encouraging teleworking. On March 
30, 2020, the authorities launched a vast cleaning and disinfection 
operation in Abidjan.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On May 7, 2020, the 
authorities announced the relaxation of the containment measures, which 
were further eased on May 14, 2020. In the Grand Abidjan district, they 
lifted the curfew and the closure of restaurants on May 15, while the 
reopening of schools and universities occurred on May 25. The isolation 
of the Grand Abidjan has been ended from July 15. The recreational 
centers will be opened on July 31.  Though, the state of emergency will 
remain in place. Regarding the remaining regions, the curfew and the 
closure of restaurants, schools and recreational facilities were lifted 
on May 8; the prohibition of public gatherings was lifted on July 30. 
Domestic flights resumed on June 26th and international flights on July 
1st. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government adopted an emergency health response plan of 96 
billion CFAF (or 0.3 % of GDP). It will (i) provide free care for those 
with the infection and equipping intensive care units; (ii) strengthen 
epidemiological and biological surveillance (virus testing; creation of a
 free call center, rehabilitating and equipping laboratories); (iii) 
reinforce capacities of pharmaceutical industries and financing research
 on the virus. On March 31, the government announced a package of 
economic measures to prop the income of the most vulnerable segments of 
the population through agricultural input support and expanded cash 
transfers, provide relief to hard-hit sectors and firms, and support 
public entities in the transport and port sectors to ensure continuity 
in supply chains. In this regard, the authorities created 4 special 
Funds to be spent over 2 years, including the National Solidarity Fund 
of 170 billion CFAF (0.5 % of GDP), the Support Fund for the informal 
sector of 100 billion CFAF (0.3 % of GDP), the Support Fund for the 
small and medium enterprises of 150 billion CFAF (0.4 % of GDP) and the 
Support Fund for large companies of 100 billion CFAF (0.3 % of GDP). 
They will also provide financial support to the agriculture sector by 
300 billion CFAF (0.8 % of GDP). On April 27, 2020, Heads of states of 
the West-Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) declared a temporary
 suspension of the WAEMU growth and stability Pact setting six 
convergence criteria, including the 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit 
rule, to help member-countries cope with the  fallout of the Covid-19 
pandemic. This temporary suspension will allow member-countries to raise
 their overall fiscal deficit temporarily and use the additional 
external support provided by donors in response to the Covid-19 crisis. 
The Heads of States’ Declaration sets a clear expectation that fiscal 
consolidation will resume once the crisis is over. </p>

</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic 
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks’ 
demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on
 economic activity. The BCEAO adopted of a full allotment strategy at a 
fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby 
allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25
 basis points lower than before the crisis. On June 22, the Monetary 
Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the
 monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO 
has also: (i) extended  the collateral framework to access central bank 
refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private 
companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance 
institutions to accommodate demands from customers  with Covid19-related
 repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period debt 
service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims 
as non-performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of 
electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a 
special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for 
limited amounts of 3-month "Covid-19 T-Bills" to be issued by each WAEMU
 sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current 
pandemic. The amount for such special T-Bills issued by Cote d’Ivoire 
amounted to 1.5 percent of GDP. Côte d’Ivoire has been recently allowed 
to issue the equivalent of 0.6 percent of GDP of new 3-months Covid-19 
T-Bills that banks may refinanced with the BCEAO for their term to 
maturity at 2 percent. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one 
year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basle 
II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory 
capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 
level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 
2023 instead of 2022 initially planned.</p>

<h3>Croatia</h3>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The Croatian economy is expected to be 
significantly affected by COVID-19, given its dependence on tourism and 
its largest trading partner being Italy. Containment started early and 
was gradually tightened from border controls, to closure of schools, 
universities, open markets, and restrictions on intercity travel. 
Croatia quickly adopted 63 different economic measures and additional 
measures were announced beginning of April in order to preserve jobs and
 alleviate the impact of COVID-19. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy:</strong> On April 23, the 
government announced a gradual easing of containment measures in three 
phases, but subject to a review after each stage. Beginning April 27, 
some retailers (except shopping malls), libraries, museums, galleries, 
service-based activities not requiring close client contact (e.g., 
tailors, photoshops, locksmiths) reopened. Public transportation in 
cities and suburbs and boat connections for islands that do not have 
ferries resumed. Beginning May 4, service industries where close contact
 with people is unavoidable (e.g., hairdressers, beauticians) could 
reopen. Public and private health systems became fully operational 
except for special cases decided by epidemiologists. Playgrounds and 
sports fields reopened. Beginning May 11, public gatherings of up to 10 
people were allowed outdoors (previously capped at 5 people). Shopping 
malls, preschools and elementary schools (grades 1-4), cafes and 
restaurants, sports and fitness centers and national parks have 
reopened. Inter-county public transportation and domestic air traffic 
have resumed. Shopping centers have begun to operate.  Public gatherings
 for cultural and sport events are permitted as of June 15. As of July 
1, 2020, all EU/EEA nationals and individuals holding permanent 
residence in the EU/EEA countries can enter Croatia freely, without 
restrictions. As of July 1, 2020, all EU/EEA nationals and individuals 
holding permanent residence in the EU/EEA countries could enter Croatia 
freely, without restrictions, while all other foreign nationals could 
enter Croatia for business, tourism, or other pressing personal reasons,
 if they provided relevant proof. The mandatory self-isolation and 
quarantine restrictions for individuals entering Croatia were lifted. 
Upon entry, individuals were given a Pamphlet with Recommendations and 
Instructions from the Croatian Institute of Public Health that they must
 follow for 14 days.  Parliamentary elections were held on July 5. As of
 July 10, several restrictions have been reintroduced following a spike 
in infections. Wearing protective masks is now mandatory throughout  the
 country in public transportation, medical facilities, shops, and malls,
 employees and clients where face to face contact is required, services 
that require close contact, drivers and all other employees in public 
transportation vehicles, as well as passengers, employees of all 
hospitality services who serve and prepare beverages and food, all 
health care workers and visitors to hospitals, etc. All travelers 
arriving to Croatia for tourism, business, urgent personal reasons, or 
educational purposes must present a negative PCR test not older than 48 
hours. Travelers with a test older than 48 hours can enter Croatia but 
will be issued a self-isolation order and will have to be tested again 
locally, at their own expense Those who do not provide a negative PCR 
test will be ordered to quarantine/self-isolate for 14 days. As of July 
30, the government has lifted the extraordinary price control over food,
 cosmetic products; the law continues to apply nevertheless to drugs, 
medicinal products, protective masks, protective gear and disinfectants.
 In July and August, several countries (The Netherlands, Finland, Italy,
 Austria, France, and Germany) have introduced mandatory coronavirus 
testing and/or self-isolation requirement for people coming from 
Croatia.</p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Key measures include: deferment of public obligations, free of 
interest for three months, which can be extended by additional three 
months if necessary; temporary suspension of payments of selected 
parafiscal charges; interest free loans to local governments, the 
Croatian Health Insurance Institute, and the Croatian Pension Insurance 
Institute to cover the deferred payments; subsidization of net minimum 
wages for three months to preserve jobs, which could be extended for 
another three months; and early refund of taxes for individuals. 
Beneficiaries of some EU Structural and Investment Funds will be able to
 receive larger advance payments. Part of the EU funds envelope has been
 reallocated to micro loans, a new credit line was introduced, 
accompanied by measures to facilitate faster disbursements of loans with
 lower interest rates, and larger partial risk guarantees. The 
government has also resorted to purchases of unsold stocks of finished 
goods in agriculture, food processing industry, medical equipment, and 
similar strategic goods. On April 1, the government announced additional
 measures, including: an increase of the subsidization of the net 
minimum wage; tax obligations of companies to be reduced or written-off 
depending on their turnover and loss; VAT payments will not be due until
 payment is received from customers and the deadline for the 2019 
financial reports will be extended to June 30. Applications to the EU 
Solidarity Fund and SURE (temporary support to mitigate unemployment 
risks in an emergency) are being considered as additional sources of 
financing/budget support. On June 25 the government announced the 
possibility of introducing a short time work program, financed from EU 
SURE, to safeguard jobs thereby employers who need to introduce shorter 
working hours due to a decline in business activities would be entitled 
to aid for the payment of a part of their workers' wages. The measure is
 intended for all sectors and for all businesses with more than 10 
employees. On September 7, the measures designed to help the economic 
sectors hit by the coronavirus crisis, including those designed to keep 
jobs and ensure liquidity and COVID-19 loans, were extended until the 
end of the year. For all sectors, the government will co-finance a 
shorter working week with a maximum HRK 2,000 per worker plus 
contributions, as well as provide assistance to micro businesses until 
end December, also in the amount of HRK 2,000 per worker, if the 
employer has suffered a drop in turnover of more than 50%. For 
activities that are particularly at risk (transport of passengers, 
hospitality, travel agencies and recreation-related businesses, as well 
as cultural, business and sports events), support is provided in the 
amount of HRK 4,000 per employee until end-December, if their drop in 
turnover exceeds 60%.  </p>

    The Croatian National Bank (CNB) has provided additional liquidity,
    supported the government securities market, and temporarily eased the
    regulatory burden on banks (
    <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hnb.hr/en/home" target="_blank">
    https://www.hnb.hr/en/home
    </a>
    ). Liquidity was provided via: (i) the structural repo facility, 
used for
    the first time since December 2018 (5-year kuna liquidity of HRK 3.8
    billion at a fixed interest rate of 0.25 percent); (ii) regular 
weekly
    repos used by banks for the first time since December 2017 (but no 
bidders
    at recent auctions). This repo rate has been reduced from 0.30 to 
0.05
    percent; and (iii) a reduction of the reserve requirement ratio 
(from 12 to 9 percent). The CNB has bought government securities in the 
secondary market (four times since March 13, in total HRK 17.9 billion).
 The European Central Bank and the CNB have agreed on a €2 billion swap 
line. The agreement is in place until end-June 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
    A moratorium for three months on obligations to banks has been introduced.
    Banks will not apply enforcement measures during this period. The Croatian
    Banking Association has agreed to defer repayment of loans to the tourism
    sector until end-June 2021. Depending on clients' possibilities and needs,
    regular interest may be paid for the duration of the moratorium, according
    to the existing payment schedule, or the loan maturity may be extended to
    adapt monthly loan instalments to clients' possibilities and cash inflow.
    The CNB has temporarily adjusted its supervisory practices in line with the
    EBA statement of March 12 (
    <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://eba.europa.eu/eba-statement-actions-mitigate-impact-covid-19-eu-banking-sector" target="_blank">

    ). Banks will not distribute dividends.
    </p>
    <p>The Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development (HBOR) has 
issued a moratorium on debt service for three months, can provide 
liquidity loans, export guarantees, and restructure obligations. In 
mid-June, HBOR announced it would extend its export loan insurance 
program (to € 150,000 from the current € 50,000) and will take on 95 
percent of the risk of non-payments by foreign buyers, thus protecting 
liquidity for SMEs. The program can insure short-term export claims by 
SMEs with an annual export revenue of up to € 2 million. Entrepreneurs 
just starting a business can also benefit from this program. The 
European Commission has approved several subsidized loan programs.</p>

<h3>Cyprus</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> After the first case was reported on 
March 9, 2020, COVID-19 spread has been brought under control since 
April 29, before a moderate surge in August. Since March, the government
 implemented a range of measures to limit the spread of coronavirus, 
including travel and mobility restrictions, a 14-day mandatory 
quarantine for travelers to Cyprus, closure of schools, hotels and 
businesses, and mandatory mask-wearing in large indoor spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> With low daily new 
infections since end-April, the government has started implementing 
lifting of restrictions in four phases. The first phase started on May 
4, allowing reopening of construction sites, retail stores and public 
sector under social distancing and health guidelines. The second phase 
started on May 21, allowing reopening of public schools and open-air 
restaurants as well as free movement within the country. The third phase
 started on June 9 allowing reopening of airports, shopping malls, ports
 facilitating cruise ships, the interior areas of restaurants and 
hotels, theaters and open-air cinemas. International travel restrictions
 remain in place for all but 35 countries. From June 24, the maximum 
number of persons at gathering has been increased gradually. Some of the
 reopening measures were partially reversed since August to control the 
surge in daily new cases.</p>

<h3>Czech Republic</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first case of COVID-19 was reported 
on March 1, 2020. The government had declared a state of emergency and a
 nationwide quarantine limiting free movement and international travel 
to contain the spread of the virus. It further implemented a range of 
measures to support the population, jobs and businesses. GDP fell by 1.9
 percent in Q1 and 11 percent in Q2-2020 compared to a year earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The list of permitted 
activities, including the reopening of shops and restaurants, has been 
gradually expanded since end-April. The state of emergency expired on 
May 17, yet several restrictions are retained. International borders 
were partially reopened on May 11, but, with some exceptions, all 
persons must provide negative Covid-19 test results to enter the 
country. These restrictions were removed for Czech citizens traveling to
 most of the EU and some non-EU European countries, and also for 
citizens of a large part of the EU and some non-EU European countries 
traveling to the Czech Republic, starting June 15. On May 25, most 
business restrictions and the requirement to wear face masks in public 
were lifted (with some exceptions, e.g. wearing face masks in public 
transport which were lifted on July 1, the Prague metro system 
excluded). On the same date, primary and vocational school classes were 
partially reopened at limited class sizes and on a voluntary basis for 
pupils. Events were phased in starting with a size limit of 300 people 
on May 25 to 1,000 people by June 22. As of July 27, due to a resurgence
 in new infections, the wearing of face masks for events held indoors 
above 100 people was reinstated. The threshold for mass events held 
indoors was lowered to 500 at any one time in any one section while the 
maximum permitted number of sections is 5 (i. e.  max. 2500 people in 
total split into 5 separate sectors of max. 500 people each). As of 
September 1, the requirement to wear face masks in public transport and 
specific indoor spaces (public administration facilities, social and 
health facilities and premises where elections are held) was 
reintroduced and extended to all indoor spaces on September 10. As of 24
 September the threshold for mass events held indoors was lowered to 
1000 in total (i. e. maximum number of 2 sectors of max. 500 seated 
people each), for mass events held outdoors  the total number of allowed
 visitors is 2000 in max. 2 with sectors of max. 1000 seated people 
each.  Events with non-seated persons are limited to 10 people indoors 
and to 50 people outdoors (with the exception of meetings of 
constitutional bodies and law-courts plus markets and fairs). As of the 
same date bars and restaurants must be closed between 10 p.m. and  6 
a.m. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government announced a fiscal package of CZK249.3bn (€9.4bn, 
4.5 percent of GDP). Until end-October, the government contributes 80 
percent of wages (incl. SSC) to employers if (i) employees are sent into
 quarantine; or (ii) employers’ businesses have been closed or reduced 
as a result of the crisis management or emergency measures taken by the 
Government. A contribution of 60 percent of wages (incl. SSC) is paid to
 employers due to obstacles to work on the part of the employer caused 
by the current epidemiological situation and related measures to prevent
 the spread of the disease both locally and abroad. Between June and 
end-August, the government waived social security contributions paid by 
employers (24.8%) with a maximum of 50 employees (if certain conditions 
are met). This support was provided concurrently with the wage 
compensation, but it was not possible to utilize both programs 
simultaneously in the same month. The government also lowered the VAT 
rate (from 15% to 10%) on selected services (accommodation, culture, 
sport) and introduced a loss carryback measure: in case of a reported 
tax loss in 2020 due to the state of emergency, taxpayers will be able 
to reduce their tax bases for this tax period for the tax years 2019 and
 2018 by this loss (maximum tax loss is set at CZK 30million). 
Self-employed were able to apply for a lump sum of CZK 500 and 
contractors of CZK 350 per day for the period between Mar 12 and Jun 8. 
The CZK 500 lump sum also applied to very small businesses (Ltd) for the
 period between Mar 12 and Jun 8. The government has also approved a 
one-off benefit for pensioners of CZK 5000. The state will further cover
 50% of rents of businesses after mandating a reduction of 30%, while 
tenants will have to cover the remaining 20%. The government has also 
approved a bonus for workers in social services and the health-care 
system of CZK 16.6bn in total. The government approved grants for 
tourism (e.g. spas, hotels, etc.) in total of CZK 4.3 bn. The government
 further pledged close to CZK 500bn (EUR 18.9bn, 9¼ percent of GDP) in 
potential guarantees. Advance payments on personal and corporate income 
tax were suspended for Q2 2020 and penalties waived for failing to pay 
property tax and file income tax returns on time. The government 
approved a moratorium on bank loans (subject to certain criteria and 
limitations) of up to six months. Interest is still accrued, and loan 
duration will be extended.</p>

 credit ratios for new mortgages, increasing the maximum recommended LTV
 ratio from 80 to 90 percent, the DSTI ratio from 45 to 50 percent and 
removing the DTI ratio from its list of recommendations (previously set 
at a multiple of 9). On June 18, 2020 the CNB abolished the DSTI ratio. 
An amended CNB act extends the CNB’s powers regarding the types of 
securities and counterparties it can engage with in secondary markets in
 case of disorderly market conditions. </p>

<h3>Denmark</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Denmark reported its first confirmed 
cases of COVID-19 on February 27, 2020. In March, the government 
implemented a range of measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, and 
to support people, jobs and businesses.

    The authorities responded to the ongoing crisis quickly and 
forcefully through various initiatives. Currently, discretionary fiscal 
support amounts to DKK 131.4 billion (5.7 percent of 2019 GDP) and 
includes increased spending for additional health care needs and 
extraordinary budgetary </a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://virksomhedsguiden.dk/erhvervsfremme/content/temaer/coronavirus_og_din_virksomhed/artikler/udvidet-ret-til-arbejdsgiverrefusionsygedagpenge-til-selvstaendige/2512f642-74bb-478e-9ffa-af2f6aeb321f/" target="_blank">measures to support workers and businesses</a>.

<h3>Djibouti</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Djibouti had its first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on March 18, 2020. The government has implemented various 
prevention measures, including restrictions of air, land, and sea 
borders, interruption of passenger flights and trains to (and from) 
Djibouti; suspension of visa issuance; confinement of non-essential 
employees, and steps to encourage social distancing (including school 
closures and cancellation of public gatherings). </p>
<p>The Ministry of Health and its partners have increased their 
preparedness by building surveillance, testing, quarantine and health 
worker capacity. The WHO has delivered protective and medical equipment,
 including tests and respirators. The Ministry of Health is 
strengthening the capacity of the medical facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The government has started
 to gradually relax containment measures from May 17. Transport, retail,
 services, construction and public administration are allowed to 
re-open. Wearing a mask is mandatory in public spaces as well as other 
hygiene measures such as hand washing and regular sanitization of spaces
 receiving the public. Other sectors will gradually be reopened in the 
next months, and the borders were reopened on July 17.  Notably, travel 
restrictions with Djibouti’s largest neighbor and trading partner 
Ethiopia were lifted in August.  The government continues to target 
those who have potentially been in contact with people who have tested 
positive. </p>

<h3>Dominican Republic</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The Dominican Republic reported its 
first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 2, 2020. Since then, the 
authorities declared a national emergency, introduced a country-wide 
curfew, closed schools, borders, and non-essential businesses, suspended
 public activities and mass gatherings, introduced teleworking 
arrangements for public servants, and enforced strict social distancing.
 The state of emergency initially ended on June 30 but was reinstated 
again on July 15 due to the resurgence of COVID-19 in the country. The 
state of emergency and nightly 5:00 pm to 06:00 pm curfew have been 
extended for a period of 45 days starting September 3.</p>
<p>The <em>Emergency and</em> <em>Health Management Committee to Combat the Coronavirus</em>,
 established on April 2, advises on response strategies, promotes 
public-private partnerships to increase the healthcare system’s 
capacity, and supervises the implementation of adopted measures. The 
Ministry of Health created an AI-based e-platform <em>Aurora MPS</em>, 
to inform citizens about the outbreak and connect them with doctors. A 
unified command center called C5i was created to centralize patient 
information from various sources and generate computer models to develop
 epidemiological profiles, predict the behavior of the virus in the 
following days, and provide a “live” number of medical personnel and 
available supplies.</p>
<p><strong>Elections.</strong> The presidential and congressional 
elections took place on July 5. PRM’s candidate—Luis Abinader—won the 
presidential vote and the change of administration took place on August 
16, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On May 20, a plan to 
reopen the economy in four phases was implemented with the reopening of 
most small businesses, including public transportation operating at up 
to 50 percent capacity.</p>
<p>On June 3, the country entered phase 2 of deconfinement with the 
reopening of inter-urban transportation services as well as 
privately-operated transportation in cities, operating at 60 percent of 
capacity. Small businesses of up to 10 employees could resume at full 
capacity, while businesses between 11 and 50 employees could operate at 
75 percent capacity. Large businesses can operate at 50 percent 
capacity. Also, religious services can take place on Sundays while 
certain activities such as gambling (but not casinos) are allowed. 
Social distancing and the use of face masks in public spaces remain 
mandatory.</p>
<p>Although phase 3 was planned on June 17, the government decided to 
remain in phase 2 following an increase in new confirmed cases. While 
each phase is planned to last for 14 days, the commencement of the next 
phase will depend crucially on the evolution of the 
pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, the tourism sector resumed activity on July 1 with 
the reopening of all regions and airports to tourists. American Airlines
 restarted its flights to four destinations (Puerto Plata, Punta Cana, 
Santiago and Santo Domingo). The government will implement a tourism 
recovery plan starting September 15, which includes non-invasive random 
tests at airports and a traveler assistance plan that covers emergencies
 in the event of contagion for all short-stay tourists (non-resident 
foreigners) who arrive between September 15 and December 31.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The original economic measures announced by the previous 
administration amounted to RD$32 billion (about US$576 million, or ¾ 
percent of GDP). These include higher <span style="text-decoration: underline;">social spending</span>: (i) the <em>Quédate en Casa</em>
 program (RD$17 billion), subsidizing the most vulnerable households, 
including informal workers. Coverage under the existing program <em>Comer es Primero</em>,
 paying RD$5,000 (about US$90) per month, increased from 0.8 to 1.5 
million households; 452,817 families will receive additional transfers 
of RD$2,000 (about US$36) per month; (ii) the newly created <em>Employee Solidarity Assistance Fund (FASE)</em>
 (RD$15 billion), which will benefit about 754,000 families of formal 
workers who were laid-off with a monthly transfer up to 70 percent of 
wages (minimum of RD$5,000, RD$8,104 on average). On May 17, a new 
program called <em>Pa’ti</em> was introduced to support independent 
workers, providing RD$5,000 a month to each beneficiary with an 
additional allowance made available for healthcare workers, the military
 and police officers, amounting to RD$2.4 billion. Newly-elected 
President Luis Abinader announced extension of all social aid programs 
till the end of 2020. The government increased <span style="text-decoration: underline;">healthcare spending</span>
 on medical supplies and equipment, tests in private labs, rent of two 
private medical centers, and support of the pharmaceutical industry, 
including through budget reallocations. On the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">revenue side</span>,
 tax relief is provided through extended payment deadlines and some tax 
benefits. The government accumulated more than RD$10 million from fines 
for the violation of the COVID-19 curfew established in March.</p>
    <p>On September 7, President Abinader promulgated a Supplemental 
Budget Law amounting to RD$ 202 trillion (4.5 percent of GDP) with the 
aim of mitigating the crisis generated by the pandemic. To cover the 
financing gaps, the authorities mobilized loans and commercial credit 
lines from the IMF<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, World Bank<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>,
 the Interamerican Development Bank, Latin American Development Bank, 
and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration; and raised 
private donations for healthcare needs. The government also placed 
domestic debt in the amount of US$ 0.7 billion (in 4 series), with the 
maturities of 10-20 years at an interest rate of 10-11 percent, and a 
global bond for US$ 3.8 (in 3 tranches), maturing in 2032, at a yield of
 4.875%.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The IMF Rapid Financing Instrument was approved on April 29, 2020, for US$0.65 billion.</p>
    <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a>
 US$150 million from a contingent line of credit for disasters and 
health-related events approved in March and another loan of US$100 
million to support the response to the COVID-19 emergency approved on 
June 20. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On March 16, the Monetary Council of the Central Bank of the 
Dominican Republic (BCRD) eased its policy stance and took measures to 
provide additional liquidity and support the economy. Interest rate 
measures include the monetary policy rate cut (from 4.5 to 3.5 percent 
per annum), reduction of the 1-day REPO facility rate (from 6.0 to 4.5 
percent), and the overnight deposit rate cut (from 3.0 to 2.5 percent). 
Banks were allowed to cover reserve requirements with public and BCRD 
bonds up to RD$22.3 billion (about ½ percent of GDP), which is 
equivalent to a 2 percent reduction in the reserve requirement rate and a
 release of RD$30.13 billion (US$553.7 million; about 0.7 percent of 
GDP) to the economy. These resources will be used for credit to 
households and businesses at an interest rate capped at 8.0 percent. On 
April 16, the Monetary Board lessened the criteria to access these 
resources by allowing financial intermediaries to lend to any economic 
sector and extended the maturity of the loans from 1 to 4 years. The 
BCRD has also made available liquidity for loans to small businesses and
 personal microcredits. The first window amounts to RD$15 billion 
accessible through Banco de Reservas. It will be available for 3 years 
and loans would carry an interest rate of up to 8 percent. At the same 
time, the BCRD released RD$5.7 billion from the reserve requirement 
(about 0.5 percent of reserve requirements) for new loans, refinancing 
of previous debt and debt consolidation for small businesses and 
personal microcredit under loans for 4 years at an interest rate of up 
to 8 percent. Liquidity measures include easing other REPO operations 
for RD$50 billion (about 1 percent of GDP) to provide funds to the 
financial system, and provisions of U.S. dollar liquidity (US$0.622 
billion, roughly 3/5 percent of GDP) through REPO operations and 
allowing banks to use public bonds towards reserve requirements on 
foreign currency deposits. Interest rate on these REPOs was lowered from
 1.8 percent to 0.9 percent. In addition, the BCRD made arrangements 
with the Federal Reserve for a liquidity facility worth US$1-US$3 
billion through short-term repos. Debt relief measures include a 
temporary freeze of debtor ratings and provisioning; classifying overdue
 loans for a 60-day period; and giving 90 days to debtors to update loan
 guarantees. In addition to these measures, on May 7, the BCRD announced
 a new facility to provide financing up to RD$20 billion for businesses 
operating in tourism, construction, exports, and manufacturing. Loans 
under this facility would carry an interest rate of 8 percent and would 
receive the same regulatory treatment as all other facilities put in 
place so far.</p>
    <p>As of September 22, out of the RD$190 billion (about 4 percent of
 GDP) made available to financial intermediation entities to provide 
liquidity to economic agents, more than RD$110 billion (2.5 percent of 
GDP) had been disbursed, providing financing to sectors such as 
commerce, manufacturing, exports, agriculture, construction, and 
tourism. In addition, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) 
granted US$ 60 million to Banco BHD León, to support loans to the SMEs 
affected by the pandemic. </p>
    <p>At the August 2020 monetary policy meeting, the BCRD lowered its 
monetary policy rate by 50 basis points to 3.00 percent and reduced its 
interest rate on the Repo standing facility by 100 basis points to 3.50 
percent. The BCRD left unchanged the rate on the deposit standing 
facility, narrowing the corridor to a band of ± 50 basis points. The 
decision on the policy rate and corridor came despite a recent uptick in
 inflation, which reached 4.35 percent in July. Market consensus 
continued to point towards inflation remaining within the target range 
of 4.0 percent ± 1.0 percent.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The BCRD has intervened in the foreign exchange markets to 
prevent disorderly market conditions and maintains a relatively strong 
international reserve position (about US$6.8 billion, or about 8.6 
percent of GDP, as of September 22, 2020). Also, the BCRD announced that
 it will expand its operations with Non-Deliverable Forwards (NDFs) to 
offer hedging instruments for international investors in local bonds 
denominated in domestic currency.</p>

<h3>Eastern Caribbean Currency Union</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The Eastern Caribbean Currency Union 
consists of eight members (Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, 
Grenada, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines) with a common central bank (the Eastern 
Caribbean Central Bank). The first case was found on March 13 (in 
Antigua and Barbuda), and the number of new cases continued to increase 
until mid-May. The COVID 19 case has since fallen and stabilized with no
 active case in most of the ECCU countries today. The global COVID-19 
shock, if prolonged to the hurricane season (August-November), could 
compound recurrent risk of natural disasters, aggravating the impact on 
the economy and society.   </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Many ECCU authorities have
 begun a gradual phased approach to easing containment measures and 
reopening the economy since early May, including the expansion of the 
list of businesses that are permitted to operate and more recently the 
reopening of borders. On May 4, CARICOM leaders discussed a phased 
approach to reestablishing intra-regional travel.   </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of August 27, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<p>Several ECCU members have announced fiscal measures.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p><em>Anguilla.</em>On April 15, the Premier announced several 
measures, including (i) unemployment assistance and direct financial 
support, (ii) waiving of duties and taxes on essential food and hygiene 
item imports, (iii) a fund to grant small low interest loans, and (iv)

<h3>Ecuador</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong> As of September 20, Ecuador has 
reported 126,419 confirmed cases and 11,090 deaths. The Government

the economy. These include closing schools and universities, public 
spaces and non-critical commercial activities, halting public transport,
 and imposing curfew. Ecuador has shut all its borders since March 18th.
 On March 22nd, the Government requested the joint commandment of the 
armed forces to manage the province of Guayas as a zone of national 
security, with the objective to enforce confinement measures, in the 
province concentrating the largest share (70 percent) of confirmed cases
 in the country.  </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The National Emergency 
Operations Committee (COE) defined new parameters for the reopening and 
the mayor of Quito announced a move to lower confinement requirements 
starting June 3.</p>
<p>In Quito, starting June 3: - Productive activities will be 
reactivated "as long as they respect biosafety protocols" in person with
 50% of the staff. - The reopening of commercial premises may operate

in a gradual and controlled way to avoid crowds. - The telework modality
 will continue in force for public officials. - The Municipality of 
Quito has the power to manage and issue the safe-conducts. - A request 
will be presented so that - in coordination with the Ministry of Health -
 the Municipality of Quito assumes the management of the epidemiological
 fence of the city.</p>
<p>In the rest of the country, “yellow confinement level” means: - The 
curfew will apply from 21:00 to 5:00 (instead of 14:00 to 05:00). -

and General Plan for the progressive return to work activities. The 
approval by the national, provincial or cantonal COE will not be 
required. - After the request of the cantonal COE in Quito, the 
presential working day of the public sector will remain suspended until 
June 15.</p>
<p>In the rest of the country, “green confinement level” means: - Curfew
 from 00:00 to 05:00. 70% of private vehicles will be able to circulate.

working day in telework mode is maintained.</p>
<p>The government adopted containment measures, closing public spaces, 
imposing a curfew, and closing its borders since March 18th through 
September 13th while the State of Emergency was in effect. Over those 
six months, decisions on pandemic control were concentrated in the 
Emergency Operations Committee (COE). For now on the responsibility for 
containment measures resides with municipal governments, subject to 
local COEs oversight.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 22, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The early containment measures focused on limiting the spread of 
the virus by closing the borders, public spaces and non-critical 
commercial activities, and imposing a nationwide curfew. These measures 
seem to have stabilized the pandemic outbreak, as the spread of the 
virus has slowed lately compared to other countries in the region 
(chart). Policy measures to protect lives and livelihoods amounting to 
$1.2 billion in 2020 included exceptional cash transfers to poor 
families ($250 million), distribution of food baskets, temporary 
relaxation of eligibility criteria for unemployment insurance ($372 
million), and additional spending on health ($550 million). These 
measures were supplemented with a deferral of payroll contributions, 
tuition, health insurance, utilities, and housing support as well as 
temporary price controls for basic food items. Measures to support 
employment included the possibility of mutually agreed changes in labor 
contracts and introduction of shorter work week and more flexible work 
arrangements on a temporary basis.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>To address liquidity shortage in the financial system, the 
authorities reduced the banks’ contribution rate to the Liquidity Fund 
by three percentage points of deposits (to 5 percent), freeing up about 
$950 million in liquid assets. This measure helped rebalance internal 
liquidity while the demand for cash also slowed gradually. In addition, 
they introduced an extraordinary deferral of private credit obligations 
on a voluntary basis (recently extended), mandated the revision of 
ceilings on interest rates, and introduced a working capital facility 
(Reactivate Ecuador) for enterprises financed by the World Bank. While 
the deferment measures will help support the real economy, if maintained
 for a prolonged period, they could weaken balance sheets of the 
financial institutions and represent downside risks for the financial 
system, especially during the transition to the post-emergency period.</p>

<h3>Egypt, Arab Republic of</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> According to the WHO, the first case of 
COVID-19 was reported on February 14, 2020. The pandemic is likely to 
impact the Egyptian economy primarily due to declining travel and 
tourist activity, reduced worker remittances, capital outflows, and 
slowdown in domestic activities as people are asked to stay home. The 
weaker demand in the global market will also reduce Egypt’s exports as 
well as earnings from the Suez Canal. The authorities have taken a host 
of precautionary measures to improve testing as well as to limit the 
community spread of the virus, including setting up testing centers, 
imposing a nighttime curfew, temporarily closing places of worship, 
temporarily halting all air travel, and encouraging civil servants to 
work from home in non-essential sectors. Authorities also suspended the 
export of all types of legumes for a period of 3 months - which has been
 extended further for 3 more months in June 2020, and they plan to start
 increasing strategic food reserves to meet domestic demand. Around 
77,000 Egyptians have been repatriated since the start of the pandemic. 
The central bank and the government are actively implementing measures 
to contain economic implications of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> According to a Cabinet 
statement on April 30, 2020, the government had started to draw up plans
 to ‘coexist’ with COVID-19 in the long term. Since the last week of 
April 2020, shopping malls and retail outlets had been allowed to open 
on weekends until 5 pm, while restaurant customers had been allowed to 
place takeaway orders in-store. Starting May 4, 2020, hotels were 
allowed to operate at 25 percent capacity until June 2020, and at 50 
percent capacity, thereafter. Egypt’s Health Ministry has published a 
3-stage plan for coronavirus management that contains required 
procedures in preparation for the gradual return of normal life in the 
country. Starting June 1, 2020, nighttime curfew was one hour shorter – 
from 8pm to 5am instead of 6am.  Starting July 2020, a gradual 
re-opening of the economy – air travel will resumed, restaurants and 
cafes opened with 25 percent capacity, stores will close at 9 pm while 
restaurants and cafes will close at 10 pm, beaches will remain closed 
until further notice, public transportation will operate between 4 am 
and midnight., All parks and specialized gardens around Cairo will open 
to the public starting on August 26, 2020, with a maximum capacity of 50
 percent. Starting September 21, funeral prayers and wedding ceremonies 
held in open-air venues have been allowed, for a maximum limit of 300 
people. Egypt has also resumed the export of medical supplies, after a 
temporary halt in March 2020.</p>

<h3>Equatorial Guinea</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 14, 2020 and the government was proactive in 
implementing substantial preventive measures at an early stage. As of 
mid-June and early August, preventive measures have been loosened to a 
large extent, and the country is now in the second of four stages of 
normalization. The loosenings lifted the stay-at-home order and closing 
of the airspace and allow businesses to reopen though some with capacity
 restrictions.  As an additional preventive measures, movement between 
districts within the country remains restricted and the use of masks in 
public is being more tightly enforced. Rates of daily new cases have 
declined steeply since July.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Fiscal policy is facing large two shocks: the Coronavirus and 
lower oil prices.
The government approved various measures to address the crisis. A broad 
emergency health spending package (1.0 percent of GDP), aims to improve 
hospital preparedness to respond to local transmission. It also deepens 
investments focused on the first response system, quarantine facilities 
for incoming travelers, and laboratory facilities/testing which had 
already been operationalized in early March. Furthermore, a social 
assistance scheme (0.3 percent of GDP)  has been approved and initiated 
for the most vulnerable and will be expanded gradually to cover 
approximately 15 percent of the population. Other spending measures were
 also taken, mainly to ensure continuity of education (0.4 percent of 
GDP); schools have also resumed in early September with class sizes cut 
in half and therefore longer school days. On the revenue side, the 
authorities are providing some targeted and temporary support to the 
private sector (estimated cost of 0.3 percent of GDP). Measures include 
halving withholding tax rates and delaying tax payment deadlines for 
small and medium-sized firms, while safeguarding public revenues, and 
reducing electricity bills for firms affected by the Covid crisis, with a
 focus on SMEs, and for households. In addition, in light of the recent 
oil price decline, Equatorial Guinea is facing a large fiscal revenue 
shock, given that hydrocarbons accounted for more than ¾ of fiscal 
revenues. To address this shock, the government is contemplating to 
mobilize more financing. The government has also been postponing 
execution of non-priority capital expenditures, identifying savings to 
non-wage current expenditures, urging public enterprises to cut 
personnel and costs as well as continuing implementation of plans to 
strengthen the tax administration.

    <p>On March 27, 2020, BEAC announced a set of monetary easing 
measures including a decrease of the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 
percent, a decrease of the Marginal Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5
 percent, a suspension of absorption operations, an increase of 
liquidity provision from FCFA 240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the 
range of private instruments accepted as collateral in monetary 
operations. The MPC also supported BEAC’s management’s intent to propose
 to reduce haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as 
collateral for refinancing operations, and to postpone by one-year 
principal repayment of consolidated central bank’s credits to member 
states, but these possible additional measures are not effective yet. 
Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities 
purchases for the next 6 months. The purchase program is meant as a 
safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances 
during the second half of 2020, while being consistent with BEAC Charter
 which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program will be based on
 revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the
 latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed 
under the IMF programs. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity 
injections with longer maturity, of up to one year.</p>
    <p>On March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use 
their capital conservation buffers of 2.5 percent to absorb 
pandemic-related losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive 
policy with regard to dividend distribution.</p>

<h3>Eritrea</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong>. The State of Eritrea reported its first 
positive COVID-19 case to the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 
21, 2020. After announcing full recovery of all 39 patients previously 
infected on May 15, the cases have started increasing again at a faster 
pace. The government imposed a 21-day national lockdown effective from 
April 2, which was extended without a timeframe on April 22. All 
citizens are compelled to stay at home except for those engaged in 
indispensable developmental and security tasks. All trading activities 
and transactions are banned during this period except in major 
productive and service sectors (manufacturing, food processing, 
construction, trucking etc.) which will continue their functions. Food 
production, supply and processing enterprises as well as grocery stores,
 pharmacies and banks will continue to provide services but must close 
at 8:00 pm every evening. All government institutions stopped routine 
services and functions to focus on indispensable developmental and 
security tasks. Except for citizens employed in institutions that will 
continue their functions, all other individuals confined to their homes 
are not allowed to use their private cars during this period. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On June 28, the government
 published the guidelines on partial reopening of schools aiming to 
reopen all schools by end of July, 2020. </p>

<h3>Estonia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the 
Estonian economy. The first case of COVID-19 was reported on February 
27. The government has implemented a range of measures aimed at 
containing and mitigating the impact of the pandemic for workers and 
businesses. The measures include travel restrictions, social distancing,
 declaration of state of emergency, distance learning for schools, ban 
of public gatherings and sanitary inspections.  The overall 
epidemiological situation is under control, although some regions report
 an increase in the number of new cases. The 2020-Q2 year-on-year real 
GDP growth was -6.9 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The Government is rolling 
out the exit strategy approved on April 27, 2020. After being in place 
for 68 days, the emergency situation ended on May 18. Shopping centers 
and restaurants reopened on May 11; ferry links between Tallinn and the 
Finnish capital, Helsinki partly reopened for work-related traffic on 
May 14; schools reopened on May 15 with most of the learning remaining 
online; Baltic states now allow travel among the three nations but 
travelers from outside the region need to undergo 14-day quarantine. 
However, children’s playrooms, casinos, slot machine halls and 
entertainment facilities including bowling alleys, billiard halls and 
adult clubs will remain closed. Gyms and swimming pools restarted 
operations on May 18. From June 1, Estonia reopened its borders to 
travelers from the EU and EEA nations without having to undergo a 14-day
 quarantine period. Bars and restaurants are now permitted to remain 
open and sell alcoholic beverages after 10 PM. Public events of up to 
100 participants are now permissible with a maximum of 50 percent 
audience/space occupancy. Estonia has started to test digital immunity 
passports, seeking a safer return to workplaces following the 
coronavirus lockdown. Government has changed the requirement to adhere 
to the 2+2 rule to a recommendation. Government has decided to ease 
restrictions on spectator capacity at public events, from 500 to 1,500 
persons for indoors and from 1000 to 2000 for outdoors, starting from 
July 15. Until August 31, it is forbidden to open direct air services 
from Estonia to high-risk countries experiencing 25 cases or more per 
100,000 inhabitants in the past 14 days. The travel restrictions are 
regularly updated on the <a target="_blank" href="https://vm.ee/en/information-countries-and-quarantine-requirements-passengers">government website</a>.
 In view of a potential new wave of coronavirus, Estonia is building a 
stock of personal protective equipment to cover the needs for a whole 
month and the university of Tartu developed a monitoring system based on
 sewage analysis to discover potential second wave of COVID-19 as soon 
as possible.</p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>In addressing the socio-economic impact of the health crisis, the
 parliament approved a supplementary budget on April 15, 2020. Under 
this budget, the government is considering a support package of about €2
 billion (7 percent of GDP) that would bring the nominal fiscal deficit 
to above 9 percent of GDP. The package would help among other things to 
buy supplies for the health facilities and to support workers and 
businesses. The package includes support to the Unemployment Insurance 
Fund to cover for wage reduction (€250 million); health insurance fund 
(€213 million); business loans to rural companies through the rural 
development fund (€200 million); guarantees/collateral for bank loans to
 allow for rescheduling of payments (€1 billion); business loans 
earmarked for liquidity support to companies (€500 million); support to 
local authorities (€130 million); investment loans to companies (€50 
million); and compensation for direct costs of cancelled cultural and 
sporting events (€3 million). The government has also suspended payments
 to the Pillar II pension fund. The government signed an order raising 
the maximum volume of short-term notes that can be issued by Estonia by 
€600 million from previously €400 million bringing the total to €1 
billion. The government has signed with the Nordic Investment Bank a 
15-year loan of €750 million. On June 3, Government successfully raised 
€1.5 billion (more than the €1 billion that was originally planned) 
through a 10-year Eurobond issue that has an interest rate of 0.125 per 
annum. Government has signed a €200 million loan with the council of 
Europe Development Bank (CEB) to finance local government’s crisis 
mitigation measures.  </p>

    Additionally, the Eesti Pank reduced the systemic risk buffer for 
the commercial banks from 1 percent to 0 percent on March 25, 2020 to 
free up resources for loan losses or new loans. The measure is expected 
to free up about €110 million for the banks. The Eesti Pank also 
announced that it will allocate ¾ of its 2019 profits equivalent to 
€18.9 million and maximum amount possible to support the state budget in
 the wake of COVID-19.

<h3>Eswatini</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Eswatini reported its first COVID-19 
case on March 14, 2020 and cases have been rising rapidly since then. In
 response, on March 17, the government has declared a national state of 
emergency, and implemented containment measures, including suspension of
 private and public gatherings of 20 people or more, schools closures, 
suspension of non-essential travel within cities for all citizens, 
closure of borders to all but goods, cargo, returning citizens, and 
legal residents, and mandatory self-isolation for residents/citizens 
coming from abroad. On March 27, a partial lockdown went into effect, 
and a month later the Manzini region, where a third of the population 
resides, went into full lockdown. The authorities in collaboration with 
the WHO have built domestic detection capacity. Economic activity has 
been affected by the closure of some ports of entry with South Africa 
and developments in South Africa. While the exchange rate against the 
US$ depreciated by 28 percent in the first quarter of 2020, it has 
appreciated by 2 percent in the second quarter. On July 29, the IMF 
Executive Board approved US$110.4 million in emergency financial 
assistance under the Rapid Financing Instrument to support authorities’ 
efforts in addressing the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Since May 8, the 
government has begun the process of carefully easing the partial 
lockdown by allowing some businesses to operate. The national emergency 
was further extended on June 19. Schools have reopened since July 6, and
 the government issued new guidelines allowing for religious and social 
gatherings under strict conditions. More businesses including casinos, 
gyms, cinemas, and public transportation have been allowed to operate 
under established WHO and health guidelines since July 13. However, as 
of September, the ban on the production and sale of alcohol remains.</p>

    <li>
    <p>In FY19/20 (ending March 31, 2020), a supplementary budget was 
approved for additional public healthcare of E100 million (0.14 percent 
of GDP). In addition, the authorities have put in place a response 
package in FY20/21 of E1 billion (1.5 percent of GDP) to increase 
healthcare capacity, ramp up food distribution and social protection 
transfers, and improve access to water and sanitation facilities for the
 most vulnerable. Food assistance has been provided, benefiting over 
360,000 people. Low priority recurrent spending will be redirected to 
the fight against the pandemic and a portion of the capital budget will 
be reallocated towards refurbishing hospitals and completing new 
hospitals. The government has set up a revolving fund of E45 million 
(0.07 percent of GDP) to assist SMEs and a E25 million (0.04 percent of 
GDP) relief fund to aid laid off workers, E7 million of which has been 
disbursed to laid off workers thus far. Revenue measures to mitigate the
 impact of the virus include: (i) taxpayers projecting losses will file 
loss provisional returns and no payment will be required; (ii) extension
 of returns filing deadlines by 3 months before penalties kick-in; (iii)
 payment arrangements for taxpayers facing cash flow problems; (iv) 
waiver of penalties and interest for older tax debts if principal is 
cleared by the end of September 2020; and (v) up to E90 million (0.13 
percent of GDP) in tax refunds for SMEs that have complied with tax 
obligations, retain employees, and continue to pay them during this 
period. The authorities have reduced the price of fuel twice and 
postponed the planned increase in water and electricity prices. For more

<h3>Ethiopia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed case was reported on
 March 14, 2020. Despite a slow rate of initial community transmission, 
the recent pace of confirmed infections has accelerated, with a peak of 
1829 daily new cases reached on August 21, 2020. Authorities closed land
 borders, closed schools, ordered the shuttering of nightclubs and 
entertainment outlets, announced social distancing measures, and called 
in retired and in-training medical personnel. In addition, all people 
entering Ethiopia from another country are subject to a mandatory 14-day
 quarantine at designated hotels at the traveler’s expense. The 
authorities postponed the elections, which were scheduled for August 29.
 On September 18, the Minister of Health tabled proposals in parliament 
for preventative measures that could be taken to allow the election to 
take place, though no timeline was announced. On April 8, the Prime 
Minister declared a state of emergency under Article 93 of the 
constitution, which allowed it to impose more stringent measures. Among 
them, most states have banned inter-regional public transport and public
 gatherings, although the international border with Djibouti remains 
fully open to transport of commercial goods. Layoffs by private 
employers have also been forbidden. The state of emergency expired in 
early September.</p>
<p>Ethiopia is highly exposed to the shock through the large 
contribution of air transportation to exports: the national carrier, 
Ethiopian Airlines, which has the largest fleet in Africa, originally 
announced the suspension of 80 flight routes, but resumed flights to 40 
destinations on July 13. Flower exports to Europe have also declined 
significantly due to lack of demand and closure of airports on the 
continent. Finally, while Ethiopia benefits from lower oil prices, the 
prices on its main export commodities such as coffee and oil seeds have 
been adversely impacted by the crisis. The potential risk for COVID-19 
transmission is high due to the large number of internally displaced 
persons living in collective sites with no options to implement the 
recommended norms of social distance, and no access to proper sanitation
 facilities and essential supplies. The dire health situation and the 
capacity challenges of the health system are exacerbated by other public
 health challenges such as cholera and measles outbreaks. According to 
projections of National Disaster Risk Management Committee, an estimated
 30 million people could experience food consumption gaps. The urban 
poor are likely to be highly affected. In rural communities, food 
insecurity will worsen among households that rely on market purchases. 
COVID-19 prevention measures in some regions will likely contribute to 
delays in movement of commercial goods (and humanitarian goods) in the 
country, resulting in localized food insecurity due to shortages of food
 items or price increases. Finally, the humanitarian community is 
concerned about the ongoing deportation of Ethiopian migrants from Saudi
 Arabia, Djibouti, Kenya and Somalia, considering the risk of COVID-19 
contagion into Ethiopia, and challenges related to their reception and 
assistance in quarantine centers.  </p>
<p>GDP growth over this fiscal year and next (starting in July 2020) is 
expected to suffer a cumulative reduction of 10½ percentage points 
relative to the pre-crisis baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> There are currently no 
plans for reopening or relaxing of containment measures described above,
 though Ethiopian Airlines has started to resume flights to about half 
of previously suspended destinations.</p>

    <p>Ethiopia initially announced a Br 300 million package to bolster 
healthcare spending in early March. On March 23, the Prime Minister 
announced the aid package would be increased to Br 5 billion (US$154 
million or 0.15 percent of GDP) but details on the precise modalities of
 the assistance were not made available. On April 3, the Prime 
Minister’s office announced a COVID-19 Multi-Sectoral Preparedness and 
Response Plan, with prospective costing of interventions of US$1.64 
billion (about 1.6 percent of GDP). The funds were expected to be 
allocated as follows: (i) $635 million (0.6 percent of GDP) for 
emergency food distribution to 15 million individuals vulnerable to food
 insecurity and not currently covered by the rural and urban PSNPs; (ii)
 $430 million (0.4 percent of GDP) for health sector response under a 
worst-case scenario of community spread with over 100,000 COVID-19 cases
 of infection in the country, primarily in urban areas; (iii) $282 
million (0.3 percent of GDP) for provision of emergency shelter and 
non-food items; (iv)The remainder ($293 million, 0.3 percent of GDP) 
would be allocated to agricultural sector support, nutrition, the 
protection of vulnerable groups, additional education outlays, 
logistics, refugees support and site management support. In practice, 
much less has been spent to date. The Urban PSNP is being temporarily 
expanded in early FY 2020/21 to cover over 500,000 new beneficiaries for
 three months at a cost of US$88 million.</p>
    <p>On April 30, the Council of Ministers approved another set of 
economic measures to support firms and employment. These include 
forgiveness of all tax debt prior to 2014/2015, a tax amnesty on 
interest and penalties for tax debt pertaining to 2015/2016-2018/2019, 
and exemption from personal income tax withholding for 4 months for 
firms who keep paying employee salaries despite not being able to 
operate due to Covid-19. </p>
    <p>On June 25, the Prime Minister’s Office released a statement 
detailing measures intended to support FDI in the country through the 
crisis and recovery, including: (i) operational facilitation of 
logistics in export and import process (such as free railway transport 
of manufacturing goods between Ethiopia and Djibouti); (ii) removal of 
taxes from the import of raw materials for the production of Covid-19 
essential goods, and lifting of the minimum price set by the NBE for 
horticulture exports.</p>
    <p>A broader set of measures including further support to 
enterprises and job protection in urban areas and industrial parks is 
under discussion with the donor community but has not been formalized. 
The Urban Productive Safety Net Programme will be expanded to 16 
additional cities over the first two months of FY 2020/21, in 
collaboration with the World Bank, at an estimated cost of $88 million.</p>

<h3>European Union/Euro Area</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong>. Since the first reported cases on 
January 24th, 2020, COVID-19 has spread across the European Union (EU) 
with a severe impact. After reaching a peak of more than 35,000 new 
daily cases in early April, and declining to about to about 5,000 cases a
 day in July, the number of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases" target="_blank">new daily infections</a> has increased again to about 16,000 cases for the past two weeks.  <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/teina011/default/table?lang=en" target="_blank">Real GDP</a>
 contracted in the second quarter of 2020 by 15.0 and 14.4 percent (y/y)
 in the euro area and the EU, respectively. &nbsp;Most European 
countries have taken several containment measures ranging from lockdowns
 and travel restrictions to school closures and bans on large gatherings
 for an extended period. As the numbers of new cases and deaths have 
moderated, some countries have started easing lockdown restrictions. On 
May 20, the European Commission proposed <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_901" target="_blank">country-specific recommendations</a>
 providing economic policy guidance to all EU Member States, with a 
focus on the most urgent challenges brought about by the pandemic and on
 relaunching sustainable growth.</p>

 for exit strategies and called for a common framework across member 
states. The criteria include: (i) sustained reduction and stabilization 
of new cases, (ii) sufficient health system capacity such as adequate 
hospital beds, pharmaceutical products, and equipment, and (iii) 
appropriate monitoring capacity to quickly detect and isolate infected 
individuals as well as to trace contacts. The Commission <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/communication-third-assessment-application-temporary-restriction-non-essential-travel-eu_en" target="_blank">recommended</a>
 Schengen Member States and Schengen Associated States to lift internal 
border controls by June 15, 2020, extend the temporary restriction on 
non-essential travel to the EU until 30 June, and set out <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1035" target="_blank">an approach</a> to progressively lifting the restriction afterwards.

    <p>The EC presented proposals to the Council for decisions to grant 
financial support of €87.3 billion to 16 Member States under the SURE 
instrument on August 24.</p>
    <p>The European Council agreed on the Next Generation EU (NGEU) 
recovery fund on July 21. It will provide €750 billion in total, 
financed by borrowing at the EU level. The funds are split between 
grants (€390 billion) and loans (€360 billion) which will be channeled 
through a special Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and a top-up to
 existing EU budget programs. Most of the money is set to be committed 
in 2021-23, with 70 percent of grants to be committed in 2021-22. To 
ensure a frontloading of disbursements, national expenditures undertaken
 since February 1, 2020 will potentially be eligible for funding. While 
the exact allocation of some of the funds remains to be determined, 
high-debt countries hit hard by the pandemic (e.g., Italy, Spain) and 
Eastern European countries will be the biggest net beneficiaries from 
the RRF. Overall, 30 percent of the NGEU and the 2021-27 EU budget will 
be targeted towards climate change related spending. The European 
Parliament and national parliaments still need to ratify the agreement 
in order for the EU to issue the debt to finance the NGEU. </p>
    <p>The European Commission’s latest package of about €540 billion (4
 percent of EU27 GDP) includes (i) allowing the European Stability 
Mechanism (ESM) to provide Pandemic Crisis Support (based on existing 
precautionary credit lines) up to 2 percent of 2019 GDP for each euro 
area country (up to €240 billion in total) to finance health related 
spending; (ii) providing €25 billion in government guarantees to the 
European Investment Bank (EIB) to support up to €200 billion to finance 
to companies, with a focus on SMEs (which augments previously agreed 
guarantees of €40 billion for the EIB’s on-lending activities); and 
(iii) creating a temporary loan-based instrument (SURE) of up to €100 
billion to protect workers and jobs, supported by guarantees from EU 
Member States. The Pandemic Crisis Support from the ESM has become 
operational and the European Council has adopted the SURE.</p>
    <p>Key measures from the EU Budget (about €37 billion and 0.3 
percent of 2019 EU27 GDP) include (i) establishing the Coronavirus 
Response Investment Initiative (CRII) and the Coronavirus Response 
Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+) in the EU budget to support public 
investment for hospitals, SMEs, labor markets, and stressed regions; 
(ii) extending the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund to include a public 
health crisis, with a view of mobilizing it if needed for the 
hardest-hit EU Member States (up to €800 million is available in 2020); 
(iii) redirecting €1 billion from the EU Budget as a guarantee to the 
European Investment Fund to incentivize banks to provide liquidity to 
SMEs and midcaps; (iv) announcing credit holidays to crisis-affected 
debtors; and (v) adopting a proposal for a €3 billion macro-financial 
assistance (MFA) package to ten enlargement and neighborhood partners to
 help them limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The 
European Commission proposed modifications to its 2020 budget to make 
€11.5 billion for crisis repair and recovery available already this 
year. The European Commission also activated the general escape clause 
in the EU fiscal rules, which suspends the fiscal adjustment 
requirements for countries that are not at their medium-term objective 
and allows them to run deficits in excess of 3 percent of GDP. After 
announcing a flexible interpretation of EU State Aid rules to support 
national support measures for critical sectors, the European Commission 
has further directed Member States to apply Article 107(2)(b) TFEU, 
which enables them to compensate companies for the damage directly 
caused by exceptional occurrences, such as COVID-19, including measures 
in sectors such as aviation and tourism. To date, national liquidity 
measures, including schemes approved by the European Commission under 
temporary flexible EU State Aid rules amounted to <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/jobs-and-economy-during-coronavirus-pandemic_en">over €3 trillion</a>.</p>
    <p>On May 8, the European Commission <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_838">adopted</a>
 a second amendment to extend the scope of the State aid Temporary 
Framework to recapitalization and subordinated debt measures to further 
support the economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. The 
amended Temporary Framework will be in place until the end of December 
2020, except for recapitalization measures which has an extended period 
by the end of June 2021. The Commission will assess before these dates 
if they need to be extended</p>

 (i) additional asset purchases of €120 billion until end-2020 under the
 existing program (APP), and (ii) temporary additional auctions of the 
full-allotment, fixed rate temporary liquidity facility at the deposit 
facility rate and more favorable terms on existing targeted longer-term 
refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) between June 2020 and June 2021, with
 interest rates that can go as low as 50 bp below the average deposit 
facility rate.&nbsp;More recently, the ECB introduced a new liquidity 
facility (PELTRO), which consists of a series of non-targeted Pandemic 
Emergency Longer-Term Refinancing Operations carried out with an 
interest rate that is 25bp below the average MRO rate prevailing over 
the life of the operation. The PELTROs commenced in May will mature in a
 staggered sequence between July and September 2021. In March the ECB 
introduced an additional €750 billion asset purchase program of private 
and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, 
PEPP), initially through end-2020. On June 4, the weaker inflation 
outlook in the ECB’s June projections prompted the Governing Council to 
expand the size of the PEPP by €600 billion to €1.35 trillion. The 
duration of the program has been extended to at least June 2021, and the
 ECB will reinvest maturing securities until at least the end of 2022. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html" target="_blank">Further measures</a>&nbsp;included
 an expanded range of eligible assets under the corporate sector 
purchase program (CSPP), and relaxation of collateral standards for 
Eurosystem refinancing operations (MROs, LTROs, TLTROs). The ECB also 
announced a broad package of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200407~2472a8ccda.en.html" target="_blank">collateral easing measures</a>
 for Eurosytem credit operations in early April. These include a 
permanent collateral haircut reduction of 20 percent for non-marketable 
assets, and temporary measures for the duration of the PEPP (with a view
 to re-assess their effectiveness before the end of 2020) such as a 
reduction of collateral haircuts by 20 percent, an expansion of 
collateral eligibility to include Greek sovereign bonds as well as an 
expansion of the scope of so-called additional credit claims framework 
so that it may also include public sector-guaranteed loans to SMEs, 
self-employed individuals, and households. In a move to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200422_1~95e0f62a2b.en.html" target="_blank">mitigate the impact of possible rating downgrades on collateral availability</a>,
 on April 22, the ECB also announced that it would grandfather until 
September 2021 the eligibility of marketable assets used as collateral 
in Eurosystem credit operations falling below current minimum credit 
quality requirements of “BBB-“ (“A-“ for asset-backed securities) as 
long as their rating remains at or above “BB” (“BB+” for asset-backed

    <p>The ECB Banking Supervision&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200312~45417d8643.en.html">allowed significant institutions</a>&nbsp;to
 operate temporarily below the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital 
conservation buffer, and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). In 
addition, new rules on the composition of capital to meet Pillar 2 
Requirement (P2R) were front-loaded to release additional capital. The 
ECB considers that the appropriate release of the countercyclical 
capital buffer (CCyB) by the national macroprudential authorities will 
enhance its capital relief measures. In addition, the ECB Banking 
Supervision allowed banks under direct supervision (i.e., the largest 
banks) to exclude cash holdings and central bank reserves from the 
calculation of their leverage ratio until end-June 2021. The leverage 
ratio is currently not a prudential requirement for banks but will 
become mandatory next year. The ECB Banking Supervision&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ssm.pr200320~4cdbbcf466.en.html">further decided</a>&nbsp;to
 exercise – on a temporary basis – flexibility in the classification 
requirements and expectations on loss provisioning for non-performing 
loans (NPLs) that are covered by public guarantees and COVID-19 related 
public moratoria; it also recommended that banks avoid pro-cyclical 
assumptions for the determination of loss provisions and opt for the 
IFRS9 transitional rules. More recently, ECB Banking 
Supervision&nbsp;extended its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ssm.pr200728_1~42a74a0b86.en.html">recommendation on dividend distributions and share buy-backs</a>

<h3>Fiji</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The Fijian authorities have been highly 
effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19. The early imposition of
 travel restrictions limited imported infections. The authorities 
reacted to the first confirmed case (on March 19) with a broad set of 
measures, including massive screenings of the population, the closure of
 the international airport, restrictions on domestic travel and public 
gatherings, closures of schools and certain types of businesses (e.g. 
cinemas, gyms, etc.), a nationwide curfew and lockdowns of affected 
areas. The number of active cases started declining mid-April and the 
last active COVID-19 patient (excluding border quarantine cases) was 
cleared on June 4. The repatriation of Fijian citizens since July led to
 a temporary resurgence of border cases that were quarantined in 
government-designated facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The authorities started 
relaxing containment and mitigation measures at the national level on 
April 26th. Phase 2 of Fiji’s COVID-safe Economic Recovery Plan, 
announced on June 21, leads to the gradual easing of some restrictions 
(e.g. national curfew, limitations on public gatherings) and the 
reopening of schools and certain recreational facilities under strict 
conditions. The reopening of the economy under Phase 2 has been tied to 
the launch of CareFIJI, a contact-tracing mobile application. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The authorities have announced two major fiscal stimulus packages
 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, one on March 26 and one on July 
17. The first package entailed up to FJ$1 billion (8.7 percent of GDP) 
in supplemental expenditures on public health, lump sum payments through
 the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), tax and tariff reductions, and
 loan repayment holidays (up to F$ 400 million of the total envelope) 
aim at protecting public health, supporting the economy and ensuring 
food security. The second fiscal package was announced as part of the 
FY2020-21 budget for the fiscal year beginning in August. The stimulus 
mainly consists of sizeable tax and tariff cuts. Fiscal and import 
excise duties on over 1,600 items are reduced or eliminated. Similarly, 
the budget includes cuts to the service turnover tax, environmental tax 
and departure tax. The budget also entails a total of F$100 million for 
unemployment assistance and a subsidy to Fiji Airways of F$60 million to
 incentivize first 150,000 tourists in new fiscal year.</p>
    <p>The government has also implemented several additional measures 
in between the two stimulus packages, including an Agricultural Response
 Package to ensure food security was also announced. It includes the 
scaling up of the existing Home Gardening program and a new Farm Support
 Package which aims at boosting the production of short-term crops 
through seeds and materials distribution. The government also introduced
 several additional allocations amounting F$50.9 million for the 
development of sugar sector. More recently, the government expanded its 
unemployment assistance, guaranteed the debt of Fiji Airways and 
announced a concessional loans initiative for MSMEs impacted by COVID-19
 as it projected the investment ratio to fall to 12.8 percent against an
 average of 20 percent for the last three years.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Reserve Bank of Fiji reduced the overnight policy rate to 
0.25 percent from 0.5 percent on March 18 to counter the economic impact
 of COVID-19. The RBF also:  (i) expanded the SME Credit Guarantee 
Scheme to assist small entities, (ii) raised its Import Substitution and
 Export Finance Facility by FJ$100 million to provide credit to 
exporters, large scale commercial agricultural farmers, public 
transportation and renewable energy businesses at concessional rates, 
(iii) raised its Natural Disaster and Rehabilitation Facility to FJ$60 
million (renaming it the Disaster Rehabilitation and Containment 
Facility) to provide concessional loans to commercial banks for them to 
on-lend to businesses affected by COVID-19, and (iv) purchased FJ$280 
million of Government bonds in the first half of 2020 to help finance 
the Government deficit.
    </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Fiji’s currency is pegged to a basket of currencies amid limited 
capital mobility. The Fijian dollar depreciated by 9 percent against the
 U.S. dollar between January 1 and March 20, 2020, before gradually 
appreciating in the period from late March to early September, rising 
above its end-2019 level. The Reserve Bank of Fiji tightened exchange 
controls on April 3 and June 11 to ensure that adequate foreign reserves
 can be maintained. It reported foreign exchange reserves stood at 
F$2371.0 million (8.7 months of retained imports) as of August 31, 2020.
 The reserves increased on account of fresh loans from ADB and World 
Bank and grant by the European Union. </p>

<h3>Finland</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed case was reported on
 January 29, 2020.  The number and incidence of new coronavirus 
infections remains small nationally but has accelerated in recent weeks.
 In response to the crisis, in addition to measures announced by the 
euro area, the Finnish government announced a package of fiscal, 
liquidity and regulatory measures which – combined with existing 
automatic stabilizers – would (if fully utilized) constitute an impulse 
of nearly 30 percent of GDP. On March 16, the government invoked the 
Emergency Powers Act, which was used to close borders, restrict domestic
 movements, and expand service obligations of essential personnel.  In 
response, unemployment climbed to nearly 12 percent in March. </p>
<p> <strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Restrictions to and from 
the region of Helsinki were lifted on April 14. On May 4, the government
 announced a plan to lift broad restrictions in favor of more targeted 
containment measures, including: on May 14, resumption of primary and 
lower secondary school and cross-border movement of essential traffic; 
on June 1, reopening of restaurants and public facilities and limits on 
public gatherings increased from 10 to 50 people; on July 31, resumption
 of public events with more than 500 people. Effective June 16, the 
government repealed the use of powers under the Emergency Powers Act, 
declaring that the country is no longer in a state of emergency. Barring
 any significant setbacks, the restrictions on gatherings will be lifted
 altogether on October 1. On June 23, the government announced the 
lifting of internal border control and restrictions on traffic between 
Finland and countries with similar incidence of COVID-19 with a limit 
value of 8 new cases per 100,000 persons in the previous 14 days. As of 
July 13, travel between Finland and non-EU countries on the ‘green list’
 approved by the Council of the European Union will be permitted subject
 to restrictions which depend on the incidence of COVID-19. On August 
13, the government adopted resolutions on recommendations for wearing 
face coverings and face masks, and for remote work. On August 18, the 
government reinstated travel restrictions on traffic between Finland and
 several countries based on their 14-day incidence rates. This is in 
addition to entry restrictions for three countries introduced on August 
6. The government adopted on September 11 a decision to continue 
internal border checks and restrictions on border traffic, which entered
 into force on September 19 and will continue through October 18. The 
government also adopted a resolution on a hybrid strategy for 
cross-border traffic and travel which requires a rapid increase in 
cross-border testing capacity and analysis by 10,000 tests/day. This 
would allow a more flexible approach to border restrictions. On 
September 24, the government reintroduced travel restrictions between 
Finland and several Schengen area countries.</p>

 to 3 percent of GDP) include additional spending for (i): healthcare 
and testing, protection and medical equipment, public safety and border 
controls, and research on the coronavirus epidemic, in particular to 
develop methods for rapid diagnostics and vaccines and a knowledge base 
for timely decision-making on coronavirus measures, (especially on the 
exit strategy) (€1 billion); (ii) lower pension contributions through 
the remainder of 2020 (€1.05 billion); (iii) grants to SMEs and 
self-employed (€650 million); and (iv) expanded parental allowance, 
social assistance and unemployment insurance (€3 billion). In addition 
to discretionary measures, automatic stabilizers are expected to 
increase the fiscal deficit by about 4-5.0 percentage points of GDP. 
Deferral of tax and pension payments for 3 months are expected to 
provide additional short-run relief of 2 percent of GDP (€4.5 billion). 
Finland is also contributing €5 million to international non-profit 
companies working on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. On April 15,
 the Finnish Government agreed to increase funding for the World Health 
Organization (WHO) to €5.5 million. This brings funding to the 2015 
level and marks a €1.9 million increase from 2019.&nbsp; On April 29, 
the government announced a €500 million recapitalization scheme for 
Finnair (which is 56% state-owned). &nbsp;On May 8, the government 
published a third supplementary budget proposal for 2020 which includes 
€700 million (0.3 percent of GDP) for share acquisitions in state 
ownership steering, €123 million for supporting restaurant and catering 
businesses, and €16 million for vaccine and drug development research. 
&nbsp;The supplementary budget proposal also includes guarantees for the
 Employment Fund (€880 million), SURE (€432 million), and the EIB (€372 
million). The total guarantee increase amounts to €1.68 billion (0.7 
percent of GDP). On June 3, the government published a fourth 
supplementary budget proposal for 2020 which includes an additional €1.2
 billion in support to households and businesses; and increased public 
investment (€1 billion). The supplementary budget also includes relief 
in the form of adjusted VAT payment arrangements (€750 million). The 
temporary loosening of unemployment insurance benefit eligibility was 
extended until the end of 2020. On June 23, the government extended the 
duration until end-2020 of temporary amendments to the unemployment 
security act aimed at enhancing labor market security and flexibility. 
On July 9, the government adopted an amendment that allows Business 
Finland to grant temporary financing to companies with financial 
difficulties that ordinarily fail to meet eligibility requirements for 
support from the Decree on Funding for Research, Development, and 
Innovation Activities. On September 3, the government published a fifth 
supplementary budget proposal for 2020 which included €60 million to 
support the most vulnerable in society for which restrictive measure 
imposed due to the pandemic have generated additional costs. The 
proposal also included an increase of €1 billion in revenue estimates 
due to less than anticipated use of flexible tax-related payment 
arrangement introduced to support liquidity. On September 24, the 
government submitted to parliament a sixth supplementary budget proposal
 for 2020 which included €200 million to support the rapid increase in 
cross-border testing capacity and analysis as part of the hybrid 
strategy for cross-border traffic and travel.</p>

<h3>France</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The coronavirus has significantly 
affected France. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on 
January 24, 2020. After a steady decline since mid-April, infections are
 on the rise again with daily new cases trending up over the last few 
weeks. Localized clusters with outbreaks are being continuously 
monitored. In mid-March the government introduced a range of measures to
 reduce the spread of COVID-19, including school closures, the ban of 
all non-essential activities, outings and long-distance travel, and the 
introduction of night-time curfews in some cities. The French economy 
contracted by 5.8 percent in Q1-2020 compared to the previous quarter. 
The French economy contracted by 5.9 percent in Q1-2020, compared to the
 previous quarter, and by 13.8 percent in Q2-2020. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>As of May 11, France 
started to ease the containment measures, beginning with the reopening 
of primary schools, shops, and industry, on a differentiated regional 
basis.  Most major domestic restrictions were lifted as of June 22. 
Internal and intra-European travel restrictions have also been lifted. 
In response to the recent uptick in infections, limits on large 
gatherings have been extended until the end of October, testing ramped 
up, and mask mandates tightened with the use of masks obligatory in most
 public spaces and indoor areas (including schools and workplaces).  
Selective regional restrictions have also been imposed in high-infection
 areas including Paris. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The authorities have introduced three amending budget laws 
between March and July increasing the fiscal envelope devoted to 
addressing the crisis to about €135 billion (nearly 6 percent of GDP, 
including liquidity measures). This adds to a package of public 
guarantees of €327 billion (close to 15 percent of GDP), including €315 
billion in guarantees for bank loans and credit reinsurance schemes. Key
 fiscal support measures include (i) streamlining and boosting health 
insurance for the sick or their caregivers; (ii) increasing spending on 
health supplies; (iii) liquidity support through postponements of social
 security and tax payments for companies and accelerated refund of tax 
credits (e.g. CIT and VAT); (iv) support for wages of workers under the 
reduced-hour scheme; (v) direct financial support for affected 
microenterprises, liberal professions, and independent workers, as well 
as for low-income households; and (vi) postponement of rent and utility 
payments for affected microenterprises and SMEs; (viii) additional 
allocation for equity investments or nationalizations of companies in 
difficulty; (ix) facilitating granting of exceptional bonuses exempt 
from social security contributions; (x) extension of expiring 
unemployment benefits until the end of the lockdown and preservation of 
rights and benefits under the disability and active solidarity income 
schemes; and (xi) support measures for the hardest-hit sectors (e.g. 
including incentives to purchase greener vehicles and green investment 
support for the auto and aerospace sectors). Some  support measures are 
being gradually phased out since June (e.g. by scaling down the 
generosity of the reduced-hour scheme), except for industries that still
 face opening restrictions (e.g. tourism, which will benefit from 
targeted exemptions from taxes and social security contributions, and 
extended support through the reduced-hour scheme and the solidarity fund
 until end-2020). On September 3rd, the government announced a new 
fiscal package to support the recovery of the French economy (“Plan de 
Relance”). The plan includes measures amounting to about 100 billion 
euros over two years and focuses on the ecological transformation of the
 economy, increasing the competitiveness of French firms, and supporting
 social and territorial cohesion. About 40 billion of this envelope is 
expected to be covered by grants from the EU Recovery Fund.</p>

<h3>Gabon</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Gabon, as all oil exporters, is being 
hit by two shocks—the global impacts of COVID-19 and the sharp decline 
in oil prices. Government policy is responding to both these 
developments. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 
12, 2020. Authorities have taken early action attempting to suppress 
COVID19. They have been following WHO-recommended measures and enhancing
 them over time. The primary measures, which included bans on social 
gatherings and travel restrictions have been enhanced over time to 
closing all borders, the air space, imposing a night curfew and a full 
lockdown in Libreville since Easter Sunday, as cases started to 
increase. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Since Monday, April 27th, 
some of these measures were relaxed, including the full lockdown in 
Libreville. A second reopening wave started on July 1st with the 
reopening of commercial flights twice per week per company from 
Libreville and a reduced night curfew from 8pm till 5am. Since 
mid-August commercial flights were further relaxed to three flights per 
company per week departing from Gabon. Public schools are envisaged to 
be reopened by November 2020. Public gatherings are still not approved. 
Travelers departing to the countryside from the two main cities 
(Libreville and Franceville) must show a negative Covid-19 test 
performed up to five days prior to departure. Since early September, the
 test for domestic trips can be performed up to 14 days prior to 
departure. Travelers flying abroad must take the test if the destination
 country requires it, whereas all passengers arriving in Libreville’s 
airport must show a negative test performed in the last five days. At 
arrival, they are once more tested by Gabonese authorities in the 
airport for posterior tracing. Accordingly, authorities have established
 a comprehensive-testing strategy and launched on May 29th a field lab 
capable of realizing 10,000 tests per day. With the equivalent to 5 
percent of its population tested; Gabon has one the highest rate of 
testing per capita of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

    <li>
    <p>The approved Amended Budget Law approved in end-June 2020 
proposes the control of non-priority expenditure and redirect savings 
and development partners support of FCFA 66.1 billion (USD 118.1 million
 or 0.74 percent of GDP) to COVID-19 related spending. The government 
also plans to allocate additional FCFA 108 billion (USD 194.1 million or
 1.2 percent of GDP) as an economic response, including through food 
stamps, electricity and water subsidies, direct support to SMEs and tax 
holidays. The Minister of Finance has created a fund available at their 
Caisse de Depots et Consignation (CDC) and designated a public 
accountant in order to facilitate disbursements of the health-related 
spending of that fund. An additional mechanism of around USD 375 million
 has further been announced to facilitate access to commercial banks 
financing for private (formal and informal) companies, including SMEs.

<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>

    <li>
    <p>On March 27, 2020, BEAC announced a set of monetary easing 
measures including a decrease of the policy rate by 25 bps to 3.25 
percent, a decrease of the Marginal Lending Facility rate by 100 bps to 5
 percent, a suspension of absorption operations, an increase of 
liquidity provision from FCFA 240 to 500 billion, and a widening of the 
range of private instruments accepted as collateral in monetary 
operations. The MPC also supported BEAC’s management’s intent to propose
 to reduce haircuts applicable to private instruments accepted as 
collateral for refinancing operations, and to postpone by one-year 
principal repayment of consolidated central bank’s credits to member 
states, but these possible additional measures are not effective yet. 
Further, at its July 22, 2020, extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC) meeting the BEAC announced a new program of government securities 
purchases for the next 6 months. The purchase program is meant as a 
safety net, to ensure full cover of government securities issuances 
during the second half of 2020, while being consistent with BEAC Charter
 which prohibits direct monetary financing. The program will be based on
 revised securities issuance plans for each country, consistent with the
 latest revised budget laws and the budget financing frameworks agreed 
under the IMF programs. The BEAC also decided to resume liquidity 
injections with longer maturity, of up to one year.</p>
    <p>On March 25, 2020, the COBAC informed banks that they can use 
their capital conservation buffers of 2.5 percent to absorb 
pandemic-related losses but requested banks to adopt a restrictive 
policy with regard to dividend distribution.</p>

<h3>The Gambia</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong> The Gambia registered its first 
COVID-19 case on March 17 involving a female Gambian returnee from the 
United Kingdom. The number of cases and the rate of infections have 
since increased, albeit, at a slow rate until mid-July. The President 
declared a state of public health emergency starting March 27, including
 closing all non-essential public and private businesses following an 
earlier order to close the airspace and land borders. Emergency powers 
were used to freeze prices of essential commodities such as rice, meat, 
fish, cooking oil soap, sanitizers and cement. To enforce social 
distancing, all commercial vehicles were only allowed to carry half of 
their licensed number of passengers. All public gatherings including 
funerals were limited to a maximum of 10 people. Notwithstanding, there 
has been a recent surge in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases mainly
 through community transmission involving a large number of healthcare 
workers and high-level government officials. This surge is straining the
 already fragile health system and stretching the government’s ability 
to properly respond to the pandemic especially in terms of testing and 
management of treatment centers.  </p>
<p>The imposition and extension of the state of public health emergency 
have not been plain sailing. The National Assembly declined to approve a
 second 45-day extension of the state of public health emergency after 
the expiration of the first. However, based on the role played by the 
emergency measures in containing the spread of the disease, the 
President used executive powers to extend it by 21 days, effective May 
19 (which is the maximum allowed under the Constitution, as the National
 Assembly was then not in session). Since the expiration of the 
extension, the President used executive powers again (on June 10, July 
1, and July 7) to make subsequent extensions mainly for 7 days; which is
 the maximum permissible period under the constitution, when the 
National Assembly is in session. Concerned by the extensions of the 
state of public health emergency without parliamentary approvals, the 
Gambia Bar Association, and the National Assembly in particular, 
questioned the legitimacy of such extensions. The Attorney General and 
Minister of Justice presented a motion at the National Assembly around 
July 13 for a 45-day extension of the public health emergency laws, but 
it failed after majority of the lawmakers voted against it. The 
situation led the President to announce another 7-day extension of the 
public health emergency laws to July 22, 2020. At the same time, the 
presidency urged the public to observe strict social distancing rules, 
and  imposed a mandatory wearing of facemasks in all public places, 
including inside taxis and other public transports, markets and schools,
 while  empowering the Minister of Health to take any restrictive 
measures required to contain the disease. With the recent surge in the 
number of new Covid-19 infections, the presidency announced another 
21-day public emergency regulation, effective August 6, 2020. The 
regulation imposes a night-time curfew between the hours of 10pm and 5am
 and reintroduces a ban on all forms of public gatherings, and closure 
of all non-essential businesses, educational institutions and all places
 of worship. A subsequent extension of the emergency regulation (made on
 August 27) eased some of the emergency restrictions, including the 
opening of places of worship, albeit under strict Covid-19 protocols. It
 also maintained the ban on public gatherings and the night-time curfew,
 which was relaxed later on September 17 together with market 
restrictions. In anticipation of the re-opening of the tourism season in
 October, and in the bid to attract tourists, the authorities have, on 
September 4, announced an amendment to their guidelines on Covid-19 
prevention. Thus, passengers arriving at the country’s airport will no 
longer be subjected to a mandatory quarantine, while those passengers in
 possession of a Negative Covid-19 Certificate of not more than 72 hours
 from the date of the test, will not be tested in The Gambia. </p>
<p>Tourism, a key driver of foreign exchange and trade, has halted. 
Interest rates on T-bills increased and remained elevated but have eased
 recently on the back of a decline in inflation and measures taken by 
the Central Bank to support market liquidity. Remittances from official 
channels have remained exceptionally high so far, in part, due to a 
reduction in private transfers through informal channels (which have 
migrated to formal channels) and remittances by the Gambian diaspora in 
response to COVID-19. Meanwhile, a supplementary appropriation bill was 
approved by the National Assembly to accommodate spending on the health 
emergency and social support, and to facilitate the recovery through 
infrastructure spending and support to the tourism sector.  </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The announcement on 
Wednesday July 22 of the lifting of the state of public health emergency
 also culminated in the re-opening of the economy, which first started 
with a gradual easing of emergency restrictions that helped a partial 
re-opening of businesses. Fuel prices were reduced to prevent transport 
price hikes and helped ease the burden on commercial transport operators
 who were then required to carry 3/4 of their vehicle capacities. The 
authorities also eased restrictions, including the re-opening of markets
 up to 6pm, the re-opening of Mosques, Churches, and schools for Grade 9
 and 12 students who were preparing for their sub-regional junior and 
senior secondary school leaving certificate exams. In response to the 
easing of emergency restrictions especially in Senegal, and the 
possibility of increases in cross-border infections, The Gambian 
authorities reiterated their resolve to protecting the country’s 
international borders (air, land and sea) and enhanced cross-border 
monitoring and control. The government has since built testing centers 
across the regions, increased the number of quarantine centers, and has 
recently converted one of the country’s main referral hospitals into a 
Covid-19 treatment center. The authorities also announced a plan to 
embark on a mass country-wide testing campaign. This plan is seriously 
affected by the recent overwhelming surge in the number of COVID-19 
cases, with a large number of healthcare workers and some high-level 
government officials testing positive. The WFP’s Passenger Air Service 
made its inaugural flight to The Gambia on June 8, 2020 with planned two
 trips per week. Brussels Airlines brought 150 passengers on June 22 and
 had since its second flight on July 3, been operating weekly ad-hoc 
flights to The Gambia, which could be affected by the new emergency 
measures. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>In mid-March, the authorities prepared a US$ 9 million (0.5 
percent of GDP) COVID-19 action plan, for which they had already 
obtained grant financing. The government  reallocated 500 million dalasi
 (0.6 percent of GDP) from the current budget to the Ministry of Health 
and other relevant public entities for containment measures to prevent 
and control the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. The government also 
launched a student relief fund to support Gambian students abroad and a 
GMD 800 million (US$ 15.8 million) nation-wide food distribution program
 to benefit 84 percent of the households. In addition, 2,000 tons of 
fertilizer were distributed to support the needs of farmers. These 
actions benefitted from technical support from the country’s development
 partners, including WFP and FAO, and are subject to enhanced oversight 
by the National Assembly. The supplementary appropriation approved by 
the National Assembly in July includes a GMD 546 million relief package 
to various sectors, including the municipal councils, public entities, 
the tourism sector, the media, and additional food assistance to be 
delivered through WFP. RCF and CCRT financing from the IMF (see below) 
helped to cover some of these additional costs.  </p>
    <p>Donor agencies, including the UNDP, WFP, WHO, FAO, UNICEF, UNFP 
and UNICEF, have focused financial assistance (about US$ 1.5 million 
cumulatively, so far) to strengthen social assistance support for 
programs aimed at vulnerable groups impacted by COVID-19 by improving 
communication, safeguarding nutrition and ensuring food security. The 
WFP provided technical support and training on targeting, design and 
distribution of the government food relief program, and it is also 
working on a food distribution program. On April 2, The World Bank 
approved a US$ 10 million grant for the COVID-19 Response and 
Preparedness Project to enhance case detection, tracing, prevention, and
 social distancing communication as well as the provision of equipment 
to isolation and treatment centers. The WB is accelerating the rollout 
of its Social Safety Net project to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19
 on the most vulnerable households. The European Commission provided, at
 end-April, a 9-million euro COVID-19 support to The Gambia and intends 
to provide an additional 5.5 -million euro financing in Q4 2020. Many of
 the other donors will also be expanding their social assistance support
 through cash transfers using mobile money and direct payments targeted 
to poor households, new mothers and farmers using existing databases of 
past recipients, village lists and voter rolls. </p>
    <p>The Gambia Revenue Authority had extended, by two months that 
expired in end-May, the filing of the 2019 annual tax return and the 
payment of final 2019 tax, as well as for the filing of the first 
quarter 2020 declaration and the payment of the first quarter 
installment. It has also revised down its annual revenue target by about
 2.2 percent of GDP. However, the revenue performance thus far points to
 a much lower revenue loss than anticipated.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Domestic financial conditions tightened in early 2020 but it has 
eased since late May . The average yield on the most utilized 364-day 
T-bills went above 11.5 percent in late May before declining in early 
September to around its end-2019 level of 7.8 percent. Encouraged by the
 drop in headline inflation from 7.7 percent at end-2019 to 5.6 percent 
in April 2020, the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) during its monetary 
policy committee meeting of May 28, reduced the monetary policy rate by 2
 percentage points to 10 percent, a cumulative 2.5 percentage points 
reduction since end-2019. The Bank also reduced the reserve requirement 
from 15 to 13 percent, thus, releasing close to GMD 700 million (US$ 14 
million or 0.7 percent of GDP) liquidity to the banks. The CBG 
maintained the policy rate at 10 percent in its latest monetary policy 
committee sittings held on August 26-27, 2020. Meanwhile, the CBG had 
used GMD 855 million of its retained earnings from 2019 to increase its 
statutory capital and settle some of the central government’s 
liabilities to the central bank, thus providing additional fiscal space 
to the government. The CBG is also actively monitoring developments in 
the financial sector. It remains in close contact with the commercial 
banks and stands ready to respond to the situation as inflationary 
pressures warrant. Additional measures are available to provide 
emergency liquidity support if needed, together with increased intensity
 and frequency of supervision to address any financial stability 
concerns. As per end-June FSIs, the banks’ financial situation has not 
deteriorated significantly relative to end-2019. The CBG successfully 
completed a remote IMF 2020 safeguards assessment mission, which found 
good progress since the last assessment in 2017. The 2019 CBG audit is 
about to be completed with a clean audit opinion. The CBG has also 
prepared a strategic plan based on the 2019 FSSR recommendations that it
 will implement along with the recommendations of the 2020 safeguards 
assessment mission.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rates and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The CBG stepped up the monitoring of banks’ FX net open positions
 but has not imposed any specific exchange measures. It is committed to 
maintaining a flexible exchange rate to absorb balance-of-payments (BOP)
 shocks. </p>
    <p>On April 15, the Executive Board of the IMF approved a US$ 21.3 
million for The Gambia under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF), which was 
on-lent to the Treasury. The RCF support supplements earlier financing 
from the IMF under a US$ 47.1 million Extended Credit Facility (ECF) 
arrangement approved on March 23, 2020. To accommodate the worsened BOP 
outlook, the IMF also agreed to modify the performance criteria on net 
usable international reserves and net domestic assets of the CBG under 
the ECF-supported program. The Gambia has also benefited from debt 
relief under the catastrophe containment window of the Catastrophe 
Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) approved on April 13, 2020. The 
first tranche of US$ 2.9 million (corresponding to debt service due to 
the Fund in the first six months covered by the initiative, April 
14–October 13, 2020) has been already approved for delivery. The total 
debt relief can be extended up to US$ 10.8 million if resources are 
identified to extend the initiative for 24 months. The Gambia is also 
seeking debt service deferral under the G20 debt service suspension 
initiative, which could provide between US$ 2.19 million (from the 
creditors that have already endorsed the initiative) and close to US$ 
6.68 million, if The Gambia’s plurilateral and private creditors endorse
 the initiative.  </p>

<h3>Georgia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Georgia has reported 2,473 active 
positive cases, 1,644recovered and 24 deaths as of September 23, 2020, 
the 30th week into the outbreak of COVID-19. The number of active cases 
increased five-fold  during past two weeksas daily incidence of cases 
peaked to a couple of  hundreds.. The COVID cases has been accelerating 
since mid-July. The Prime Minister described the present situation as 
the second wave of the pandemic.  Only severe patients are treated at 
the hospitals. Less severe patients are treated inspecially designated 
hotels. The government is considering home treatment protocol for low 
symptom patients. Entry and exit to Adjara region is controlled by 
epidemic services as Adjara was the major destination for summer 
domestic tourism which has become a red zone. On the other hand, the 
mountainous villages, that were locked down for the month of August, 
re-opened on Sept 2.   The government officials stated that there will 
not be a new lock down.  </p>
<p>Earlier in the year, on May 22, 2020, parallel to the decreasing 
number of the active COVID cases, the government ended the national 
state of emergency and accelerated the pace of opening the economy. 
During the two months that the country lived under the state of 
emergency and curfew (March 21 to May 22, 2020), strict containment 
measures were imposed, including social distancing, lock down of 
high-risk districts, closure of border crossing, travel ban for foreign 
visitors, quarantine for nationals returning to Georgia, closure of 
shops (other than groceries and gas stations) and schools; a two-week 
ban on the private vehicle intercity movement (ended on April 27<sup>th</sup>);
 prohibition of intercity and intracity public transport movement (ended
 in late May). Various forms of economic activity, including tourism, 
came to a standstill during the state of emergency. Since the reopening,
 the recovery in economic activity has been slow as borders remain 
closed and international travel is broadly banned. On July 1 the EU 
listed Georgia among the 15 safe countries and announced readiness to 
accept the Georgian citizens in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Initially, Georgia reciprocated by opening the international travel to 
the citizens of Germany, France; Latvia; Lithuania and Estonia. However,
 in September, as the COVID cases increased, Georgia imposed a 
requirement to hold valid PCR test results for all foreign arrivals, 
including the citizens of the abovementioned countries. The number of 
quarantine days for the returning citizens reduced from 14 to 8 days, 
but they are required to take a PCR test on the 12<sup>th</sup> day. 
Public outdoor gatherings of above 200 people are prohibited from 
September 10. Public indoor gatherings for rituals (parties, funerals) 
shall be limited to max 10 people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The regular international flights are still expected to resume 
in October. To reduce unemployment, the Georgian government allowed the 
Georgian citizens to travel for work to the neighboring Turkey, provided
 they have at least 3-month invitation from the perspective employer. 
Upon return, they will have to quarantine themselves for 2 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the Economy.</strong> On April 24, the 
government presented a timeline for opening the economy in 6 stages, 
conditional on the trends of COVID19 statistics. It was planned to keep a
 2-week gap between the stages, but the improving COVID19 statistics and
 steady decline in the number of the active cases of COVID 19, allowed 
the government to open the economy quicker. The first stage of opening 
commenced on April 27, 2020 as the passenger cars, taxies, online trade,
 deliveries and open air-markets became operational. Starting from May 
5: construction, production of construction materials, carwash, computer
 and equipment repair shops, parks are open. Since May 11, all shops 
that have their own entrance from ground (other than malls, apparel and 
footwear shops) are open; all kinds of production and publishing 
services are also operational. The beauty parlors and aesthetic medical 
centers also opened faster than initially planned (May 18th). Tbilisi 
and other big cities are now open for intercity travelers. The public 
transport, including metro, resumed operation on  May 29; All types of 
shops as well as the malls opened on June 1; all the restaurants and 
hotels opened on June 8; (i.e. about 1 month earlier than initially 
planned), however, all the above-mentioned need to observe strict 
cautionary measures: wearing face masks is mandatory inside the shops 
and while using public transport. The sports halls and swimming pools 
resumed their operations from July 7th. Similar to the hotels, to become
 operational, they also need a prior authorization from the ministry of 
health. Effective July 13, outdoor cultural events and indoor rehearsals
 were allowed. Domestic tourism opened on June 15th. Public schools are 
scheduled to resume inhouse classes on the 15th of September 2020, 
however in red zones, only on-line lessons will be allowed. The Ministry
 ofEducation approved an order regulating online schooling. The 
kindergartens are still planned to reopen on October 1. Opening of 
theatres and cinemas, as well as child entertainment centers, is 
postponed from October 1 to November 1. The parliamentary elections are 
planned for October 31st.</p>

the pandemic. </p>
<ul>
    <li>
    1. The government will provide GEL 200 one-time assistance to all

    <p>The National Bank of Georgia (NBG) announced measures to support 
capital and liquidity in the banking sector. Banks have been asked to 
evaluate the quality of the loan portfolio; on-site inspections have 
been suspended; and a moratorium on fines was introduced where a breach 
emerged due to the crisis. The NBG reduced its policy rate cumulatively 
by 100 bps since April 2020 (by 50 bps on Apr 29; 25 bps on Jun 24, 
2020;  25 bps on Aug 5). NBG kept the policy rate at 8 percent at the 
Sep 16 MPC meeting. Next MPC meeting will be held on Oct 28th. The 
office operations of currency exchange booths and other payment service 
providers are fully operational since early June, after closing them for
 2 months due to the pandemic. To ease lari liquidity pressures, the NBG
 started FX swap lines with banks and microfinance institutions in 
mid-April. In addition, starting June 1 the NBG launched a new tool for 
liquidity management to support the financing of small and medium-sized 
businesses in Georgia, which consists of two components: the first is 
for commercial banks, which receive liquidity support from the NBG in 
exchange for mortgaging the loan portfolio; the second component is for 
micro-financing organizations. The depreciation in Georgian Lari has 
gained pace over the last weeks, along with the deteriorating epidemic 
situation and lari depreciated by 17.3 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
 since March 6th .</p>

<h3>Germany</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Germany registered the first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on January 27th, 2020. The government has responded with a
 range of measures to contain the spread of virus through border 
closures, closure of schools and non-essential businesses, social 
distancing requirements, enforcement of mask-wearing, and a ban on 
public gatherings. Following a steady decline since early-April, 
infections are again on the rise, with daily new cases gradually 
trending up since late July.   </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On April 20th, smaller 
shops re-opened subject to social distancing requirements. Select grades
 in schools gradually re-opened on May 4th, as did cultural and leisure 
venues. On May 6th, the government announced further easing of 
containment measures extending to all shops, restaurants and sports 
facilities, with the exact timeline to be determined at state level. 
Re-opening is subject to an “emergency brake”, whereby an occurrence of 
more than 50 new infections per 100.000 inhabitants over 7 days will 
require state governments to reverse the re-opening and re-institute 
containment. Border controls to neighboring countries are being 
gradually lifted starting May 16th. Quarantine requirement for travelers
 from EU-countries has been lifted in several states starting May 18th. 
On May 26th, federal and state governments agreed to ease restriction on
 public gatherings for up to 10 people or two separate households 
subject to minimum distancing and face mask requirement in public 
places. The travel warning to all EU countries, Schengen states, the UK 
and Northern Ireland, has been lifted on June 15th though some “high 
risk” destinations have been put under travel warning as infections 
resumed On June 16th, the government launches a Corona Warning App that 
allows users to trace potential contact with Covid-infected individuals 
on a voluntary and anonymous basis. On July 1st, the entry restriction 
for travelers from 11 non-EU countries is lifted (3 of which conditional
 on reciprocity). In light of the rising number of new infections in 
Germany since  the summer vacation season, a mandatory COVID-19 test 
requirement for people entering from around 130 “high risk” countries 
upon their arrival came in effect on August 8th. Mass events remain 
banned until at least end-2020 and some local governments have tightened
 limitations on public gatherings.  </p>

<h3>Ghana</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Ghana registered the first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on March 14, 2020. Starting March 16, the government 
adopted sweeping social distancing measures and travel restrictions to 
avert an outbreak, including (i) suspension of all public gatherings 
exceeding 25 people for four weeks; (ii) closure of all universities and
 schools until further notice; and (iii) mandatory 14-day 
self-quarantine for any Ghanaian resident who has been to a country with
 at least 200 confirmed cases of COVID-19, within the last 14 days. On 
March 23, Ghana closed all its borders to travelers. On March 30, a 
partial lockdown of major urban areas was implemented. As an oil 
exporter, Ghana is significantly affected by the volatility in oil 
prices.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The partial lockdown was 
lifted on April 23 following expansion of treatment and isolation 
centers, enhanced testing and contact tracing capacity, increased 
capacity to produce sanitizers and medicines, and the severe impact of 
the lockdown on the most vulnerable. Phase One of the process of easing 
restrictions began on June 5. Provided social distancing restrictions 
were met, religious services for fewer than 100 congregants were 
allowed, and schools and universities re-opened so that older students 
could resume classes ahead of exams. Phase Two started on August 1, 
lifting restrictions on the number of congregants for religious services
 and opening tourist sites. However, beaches, pubs, cinemas and 
nightclubs remain closed. International flights resumed from September 
1, subject to enhanced COVID-19 protocols. Land and sea borders continue
 closed for human traffic.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government has so far committed a total of GHc 11.2 billion 
to face the pandemic and its social and economic consequences. The bulk 
of these funds (GHc 10.6 billion) are being used under the Coronavirus 
Alleviation Programme to support selected industries (e.g., 
pharmaceutical sector supplying COVID-19 drugs and equipment), support 
SMEs, finance guarantees and first-loss instruments, build or upgrade 
100 district and regional hospitals, and address availability of test 
kits, pharmaceuticals, equipment, and bed capacity. Another GHc 600 
million were used initially to support preparedness and response.</p>
    <p>To compensate for larger spending related to the COVID-19 crisis,
 the government plans to cut spending in goods and services, transfers, 
and capital investment (also reflecting the lower absorption capacity 
due to the pandemic), for a total of at least GHc 1.1 billion (0.3 
percent of GDP). In addition, the government has agreed with investors 
to postpone interest payment on non-marketable domestic bonds held by 
public institutions to fund the financial sector clean-up for about GHc 
1.2 billion (0.3 percent of GDP). The government has also drawn US$218 
million from the stabilization fund, and will borrow up to GHc 10 
billion from the Bank of Ghana.</p>

<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut the policy rate cut by 
150 basis points to 14.5 percent on March 18, and announced several 
measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic shock, including 
lowering the primary reserve requirement from 10 to 8 percent, lowering 
the capital conservation buffer from 3 to 1.5 percent, revising 
provisioning and classification rules for specific loan categories, and 
steps to facilitate and lower the cost of mobile payments. The committee
 also signaled it would continue to monitor the economic impact of 
COVID-19 and take additional measures if necessary.</p>
    <p>At its May 15 meeting, the MPC kept the policy rate unchanged and
 announced a new bond purchasing program to provide emergency financing 
to the government in light of a higher projected fiscal financing gap. A
 10-year bond with a face value of GHc 5.5 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) 
has been purchased, and the MPC indicated that future purchases may 
increase up to GHc 10 billion. The MPC also announced relief measures 
for small depository institutions and a US$1 billion repo agreement with
 the U.S. Federal Reserve under its FIMA facility.</p>

<h3>Greece</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on February 26, 2020. The government adopted strict containment
 measures during the second quarter of 2020 to delay the spread of 
coronavirus, including: (i) a national lockdown that restricted all but 
essential movement and economic activity, (ii) school closures, (iii) 
domestic travel restrictions, (iv) travel bans on visitors from 
high-risk countries; and (v) quarantines for international visitors and 
Greek nationals returning from abroad.  </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The government implemented
 a gradual re-opening, close to full normalization of economic activity 
(except for large public events), as of July 1st. As a result of rising 
cases in August, the government has reinstated targeted restrictions in 
selected areas.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>

    <p>The government has announced a fiscal package of measures 
totaling about 14 percent of GDP (€24 billion), including loan 
guarantees, financed from national and EU resources (some of the latter 
involves reprogrammed funds). Key measures include: (i) health spending 
for hiring of 3,300 doctors and nurses, procurement of medical supplies,
 and cash bonuses to health sector workers; (ii) temporary transfers to 
vulnerable individuals, including  cash stipends and full coverage of 
pension and health benefit payments for employees working in hard hit 
firms and for self-employed professionals, extension of unemployment 
benefits, support for short-term employment, subsidies to households 
with delinquent loans tied to their primary residency and paid leave for
 parents who have children not going to school; (iii) liquidity support 
to hard hit businesses through loan guarantees, interest payment 
subsidies, refundable advance payment, rent reductions, and deferred 
payments of taxes and social security contributions; and (iv) VAT rate 
reductions for critical products needed for COVID protection, research 
spending and transportation and hospitality sectors.</p>

 additional auctions of the full-allotment, fixed rate temporary 
liquidity facility at the deposit facility rate and more favorable terms
 on existing targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) 
from June 2020 through June 2021. Greece is also eligible for the new 
liquidity facility (PELTRO), which consists of a series of non-targeted 
Pandemic Emergency Longer-Term Refinancing Operations carried out with 
an interest rate that is 25bp below the average MRO rate prevailing over
 the life of the operation. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html" target="_blank">Further measures</a>

    to exercise – on a temporary basis – flexibility in the classification
    requirements and expectations on loss provisioning for non-performing loans
    (NPLs) that are covered by public guarantees and COVID-19 related public

<h3>Guatemala</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>On March 13th, the government declared a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.minfin.gob.gt/images/calamidad/documentos/Decreto%20No%205-2020%20-%20COVID-19.pdf" target="_blank"><em>State of Calamity</em></a>,
 extended recently through October 5th, which has allowed to implement 
several provisions to counter the effects of the pandemic. Over the last
 month, the government has been gradually re-opening the economy. Border
 offices at the country’s frontiers and the international airport La 
Aurora have resumed their activities this week. Six months into the 
pandemic, President Giammattei, infected with COVID-19, has submitted to
 mandatory quarantine and relinquished to all official activities while 
maintaining communication with the economic cabinet. Several top 
government officers (including in the military) have been also diagnosed
 with the disease.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>•	For COVID-19 prevention and mitigation, Congress approved three
 fiscal packages, totaling around 3.4 percent of GDP. This fiscal 
stimulus was financed mainly by IFIs concessional loans and the issuance
 of treasury bonds. The fiscal response is now focused on two programs: 
i) stepping up healthcare resources (0.2% of GDP) and ii) providing 
support to different sectors in the economy through cash transfers (1.2%
 of GDP), salary subsidies (0.3% of GDP) and funding to SMEs (0.6% of 
GDP). As part of the National Emergency and Economic Recovery Plan, 
additional targeted measures were enacted: i) streamlining tax refunds 
to exporters, ii) deferring income tax payments and social security 
contributions (one quarter), iii) waiving taxes on medical supplies, iv)
 increasing the coverage and amount of electricity subsidies, and v) 
fostering low income housing.   </p>

    <li>
    <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.banguat.gob.gt/Publica/Prensa/boletin_tasa_int_covid.pdf" target="_blank">Banco de Guatemala</a>
 lowered its policy rate by 75 basis points to 2 percent on March 18. To
 support further the financial sector, the Monetary Board eased through 
year-end credit regulations to facilitate loan restructuring for 
borrowers facing temporary liquidity constraints, due to the impact of 
the pandemic. On June 24, the Monetary Board cut its policy rate by an 
additional 25 basis points to 1.75 percent, in response to the 
detrimental impact on domestic growth from weaker global conditions than
 initially foreseen.</p>
  
    <p>Upon Congress’ special authorization, Banco de Guatemala could 
purchase GTM Treasury Bonds for up to GTQ 11 billion (about USD 1.5 
billion). The government has been using the proceeds to finance programs
 for the COVID-19 emergency. Thus far, GTQ 9.5 billion (86.4 per cent of
 the total bond issuance authorized by Congress) has been purchased by 
Banguat already.</p>
    <p>The Superintendency of Banks continues closely monitoring the 
incidence in the financial system of the temporarily relaxation of 
credit risk regulations. Through the end of April, over 1.6 million 
applications were submitted for a loan renegotiation.</p>

<h3>Guinea</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Guinea reported its first COVID-19 case 
on March 12, 2020. Since then, the contagion has spread rapidly. The 
authorities have adopted several measures to reduce the risk of 
contagion. Notably, large public gatherings have been banned, the 
international airport has been closed to non-essential flights, and 
public areas (markets, religious facilities) are required to have hand 
sanitizing equipment. All schools have been closed. Other measures 
included closure of land borders, suspension of public events, 
religious, and leisure facilities; limiting public transport; and a 
nationwide night curfew. Guinean embassies and consulates have suspended
 visa issuance to travelers from countries with more than 30 confirmed 
cases. On March 26, Guinea declared a state of emergency and tightened 
lockdown. Since then, the state of emergency has been renewed every 
thirty days with the latest extension announced on August 14. Starting 
April 18, wearing a face mask is mandatory in public places.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong> On May 15, Guinea 
extended the containment measures but started easing the lockdown 
restrictions. The authorities lifted the curfew in the rest of the 
country and relaxed the limit on mass gatherings from 20 to 30 people. 
The curfew remains in force in the greater region of Conakry but is 
shortened from 10pm - 5am to 11pm - 5am. </p>
<p>On May 25, Guinea updated its travel advisory, requiring all 
travelers to provide proof of a COVID-19 test result and upon arrival, 
to undergo another test and a mandatory 14-day quarantine. In addition, 
foreign nationals must undergo a 14-day quarantine prior to their 
travel.</p>
<p>On June 15, Guinea announced further measures to ease lockdown 
restrictions. Since June 22, worship places in prefectures without new 
cases for 30 consecutive days were able to resume services. Universities
 and school-classes preparing for official examination reopened on June 
29. To support the reopening, schools, universities and public markets 
are subject to regular disinfecting. Sanitary kits are distributed to 
schools, universities and places of worship.</p>
<p>On July 15, Guinea further relaxed the curfew in Conakry and nearby 
areas to midnight to 4am. International commercial flights resumed 
gradually starting July 17.</p>
<p>On September 22, the Guinean authorities lifted the capacity 
restriction on public transportation, announced the reopening of bars, 
restaurants and motels, and the resumption of cultural and social 
activities. Mask wearing and social distancing measures remain in 
effect.</p>

<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>A National Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for a 
COVID-19 outbreak was prepared, with the support of international 
development partners. Key measures focus on strengthening surveillance 
at ports of entry; reinforcing capacity for COVID-19 detection; 
increasing the number of quarantine centers; expanding treatment 
facilities and acquiring needed medical equipment; and conducting a 
communication campaign. The implementation cost of the National 
Emergency Plan is estimated at US$47 million (0.3 percent of GDP).</p>
    <p>In addition, a COVID-19 economic response plan was announced on 
April 6, 2020. The Plan aims at strengthening infrastructure in the 
health sector, protecting the most vulnerable, and supporting the 
private sector, notably small and medium enterprises. The authorities 
estimate the cost of the Plan at about US$ 328 million (2.3 percent of 
GDP). Key measures include: the introduction of temporary exonerations 
on taxes, social contributions and payment of utilities for firms in the
 most affected sectors; the implementation of labor-intensive public 
works, provision of cash transfers, a waiver on the payment of utilities
 for the most vulnerable. </p>
    <p>On June 23, the authorities announced additional measures, 
including a three-month extension of some measures initially planned 
till end-June. The additional cost is estimated at about US$ 50 million 
(0.34 percent of GDP). Additional measures include: support to the 
agricultural sector; exemption from the payment of utility bills for 
businesses in the tourism and hotel sectors; reduction of taxes on 
health and life insurance contracts; exemption from the payment of the 
apprenticeship tax as an incentive to retain workers; and import duty 
exemption on fishing equipment. </p>

    <p>As announced in the April 6 COVID-19 economic response plan, the 
central bank of the Republic of Guinea (BCRG) unveiled on April 16 some 
support measures to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic on the 
financial sector. The policy rate and the reserve requirement ratio were
 both reduced by 100 basis points to 11 and 15 percent respectively. The
 BCRG allows banks, for the duration of the pandemic, to count against 
their reserves credit provided to SMEs, businesses in the services 
sector affected (hotels, restaurants and transport), and major importers
 of food and pharmaceutical products. The central bank also announced a 
program of liquidity injection, including a window for the provision of 
long-term liquidity.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the central bank announced measures to mitigate 
prudential requirements. These include: lowering the liquidity coverage 
ratio from 100 to 80 percent; suspending the NPL classification for 
businesses and individuals impacted by the pandemic and the provisioning
 of such loans; and relaxing the limits on foreign exchange positions 
(from 20 to 25 percent of capital for the net position, and 10 to 12.5 
percent for the position in each currency). Dividend payments have been 
suspended while financial institutions are required to limit technical 
assistance fees paid to their parent companies to the strict minimum. 
Financial institutions have been granted a three-month postponement of 
the payment of supervision -related fees as well as contributions to the
 deposit insurance scheme. Insurance companies are to postpone the 
payment of premia falling due during the epidemic and to suspend 
policies at the request of customers. Identification requirements for 
e-money accounts have been eased and companies are encouraged to reduce 
e-money transfer fees.</p>

<h3>Guinea Bissau</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first cases were reported on March 
25 and have kept increasing since then. On March 18, borders were 
preemptively closed. Flights to Bissau resumed in September. Schools 
remain closed. A state of emergency was declared on March 28 and 
extended eight times until September 8 when a “state of calamity” was 
declared for ninety days. This entails more stringent confinement and 
testing and reinforces prevention measures. Guinea-Bissau was amongst 
the 25 beneficiary countries of the IMF debt service relief through the 
Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT), approved on April 15.</p>

<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government has increased monthly health expenditure by CFAF 
222 million (US$ 0.4 million) to purchase medicine, food, services, and 
equipment for hospitals. Authorities took other various emergency 
health-related measures of CFAF 2.753 million (US$ 5 million or 0.3 
percent of GDP). The authorities are seeking support from multilateral 
donors to finance additional expenses. The government has also provided 
some assistance to households. CFAF 580 million (US$ 1 million or 0.07 
percent of GDP) were used to distribute 20,000 bags of rice and 10,000 
bags of sugar throughout the country. The authorities are seeking 
international financial support to complement its assistance program. </p>

</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic 
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks’ 
demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on
 economic activity. The BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a 
fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby 
allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25
 basis points lower than before the crisis. On June 22, the Monetary 
Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the
 monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO 
has also: (i) extended the collateral framework to access central bank 
refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private 
companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance 
institutions to accommodate demands from customers with COVID-19 related
 repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period debt 
service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims 
as non performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of 
electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a 
special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for 
limited amounts of 3-month "Covid-19 T-Bills" to be issued by each WAEMU
 sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current 
pandemic. The amount of such special T-Bills issued by Guinea Bissau is 
equivalent to 1.9 percent of GDP. Guinea-Bissau has been recently 
allowed to issue the equivalent of 1.2 percent of GDP of new 3-months 
Covid-19 T-Bills that banks may refinance with the BCEAO for their term 
to maturity at 2 percent. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by 
one year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to 
Basle II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory
 capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 
level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 
2023 instead of 2022 initially planned. </p>

<h3>Guyana</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Guyana reported its first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on March 11, 2020. The government has announced 
containment and mitigation measures (including imposing staying home 
order, bans on public gatherings, except for essential services, 
mandatory social and physical distancing for essential services, 
curfews, domestic and international travel restrictions, closure of 
schools and borders, mandatory quarantine for those infected or exposed 
to the disease, providing tests to suspected infection cases, and 
additional supplies to medical professions, and raising public 
awareness). Guyana has been one of five countries in the Caribbean 
including the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Aruba and Curacao, to benefit 
from pre-manufactured housing units from the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The international organization handed
 over 48 housing units to the Ministry of Public Health through the 
Civil Defense Commission (CDC) to boost the regional capacity of the 
COVID-19 response in the country. On July 21, the Ministry of Education 
received a donation of 2000 face shields from the United Nations 
International Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to support measures to contain 
the spread of the COVID-19 virus in schools, when they open. The new 
government announced the establishment of a new Covid-19 response unit 
to replace the previous National COVID-19 Task Force, including G$4.5 
billion (US$21.6 million) for the COVID-19 response effort, and started 
making efforts to mobilize US$60 million from international financial 
institutions. More recently, the government received US$2 million from 
India, and announced G$25,000 per household for COVID-19 relief 
assistance. It is still unclear whether the aid would be in cash or 
kind, how often this will be provided and whether all or affected 
households will be getting assistance. In addition, authorities 
announced packages for essential workers, and under the childcare 
assistance program, direct payments would be made to licensed child care
 facilities for disbursements to parents of children under seven years 
of age.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The government announced a
 six-phase re-opening of the economy commencing on June 18. During 
Phases 1 and 2, all food establishments were permitted to operate 
takeout and delivery services from 6am to 5pm, however; dine-in services
 were still prohibited. Hardware, plumbing and electrical stores were 
allowed to operate from 6am to 5pm, while public transportation was 
permitted to continue operating at 50 percent capacity. Ninety minutes 
of exercise were allowed during the week from 6am to 6pm in open public 
spaces. Phase 3 began on July 17 and ended on July 31. Social distancing
 rules and the wearing of face masks continue to be mandatory. Bars, 
sporting events and gatherings of more than ten persons are still 
prohibited, and stay-at-home orders remain in effect except for 
essential services. During phase 3, the national curfew was from 8pm to 
6am except for regions 5 and 6. Food services and restaurants were 
allowed to open for delivery, drive-thru, and curb-side pick-up service 
from 6am to midnight daily, however; outdoor dining at restaurants are 
still under the updated national curfew regulations from 6am until 6pm. 
Public transportation services (except in Aranka, Arangoy, and Moruca) 
were allowed to operate at a 75 percent passenger capacity, and private 
sector construction, clothing, shoe and bookstores were allowed to 
resume operations. Phase 4 reopening began on August 1, with further 
easing of restrictions including opening of places of worship and 
ceremonies, and gatherings allowed at 25 percent capacity. The opening 
of the airspace was postponed until September 30, as the number of 
confirmed cases continued to rise, and emergency measures have been 
extended starting September 1 until September 30 reverting previous 
curfew hours from 6PM to 6AM. The new government is also working on a 
plan to reopen the Guyana-Suriname border to facilitate trade and 
travel.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Ministry of Finance and the Guyana Revenue Authority have 
implemented waivers of VAT and duties on COVID-19 medical supplies and 
lab testing kits, as well as tax deductions for all donations made by 
local businesses to staff and health institutions for the treatment of 
the virus. The authorities have also implemented the removal of VAT on 
water and electricity effective from April 01, 2020 to September 30, 
2020; domestic air travel effective from April 08, 2020 to September 30,
 2020; and the extension of the April 30th deadline for the filing of 
tax returns to September 30, 2020.  The authorities have also expedited 
the processing of VAT refunds for businesses and pay as you earn refunds
 to employees. All affected businesses will now be allowed to pay 
advance taxes on the current year basis for the Year of Assessment 2021 
(Year of Income 2020). The Ministry of Business has started providing 
relief grants to small businesses experiencing challenges to sustain 
operations and retain employees and for training and development. Most 
recently, the Ministries of Business and Agriculture began working to 
assist farmers affected by the pandemic with stimulus grants, and the 
Department of Tourism in the Ministry of Business has collaborated with 
the Guyana Tourism Authority, and other bureaus to establish the Tourism
 Recovery Action Committee (TRAC). On July 1, the government resumed the
 public assistance program after 2 months pause to facilitate a 
long-term strategic approach to Covid relief efforts. The assistance 
includes vouchers and packaged hampers for the coastland and the 
hinterland respectively. On September 10, the new government presented 
its G$330 billion emergency budget, which includes funds for combating 
COVID-19, and revitalizing productive and infrastructure sectors. Most 
importantly, the allocations for each of the health and education 
sectors account for approximately fifteen percent of GDP each.</p>

2020. The institution also reduced reserve requirements from 12 percent 
to 10 percent; lowered liquid asset requirements for demand deposits 
from 25 percent to 20 percent, and savings and time deposits from 20 
percent to 15 percent. The commercial banks will provide short term 
financing for working capital at concessional rates of 5-6 percent, and 
reduce interest rates on consumer loans below G$10 million by 1-2 
percent until December 2020. Other measures proposed to banks by the BoG
 include; the deferment of loan payments to assist customers in good 
standing, companies with liquidity requirements; and waiving or reducing
 fees and penalties for transactions with ATMs, POS, EFT, debit cards, 
loan processing, late payments on loans and special treatment on

<h3>Haiti</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic comes at a time of
 economic contraction and considerable macro-economic imbalances. Haiti 
reported its first confirmed cases of COVID-19 on March 20, 2020. 
Tourism had already declined sharply in 2018-2019 due to the political 
instability and social unrest. The main economic impact from COVID-19 
will come through remittances, which represent about 30 percent of GDP 
and are expected to drop with the income shock in the United States and 
other source markets.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The state of health 
emergency that had been declared by the Government on April 19th over 
the spread of COVID-19 has been lifted eon July 20. The Prime Minister 
announced the end of restrictive measures and the resumption of business
 operations across the country, including, among others, the reopening 
of textile factories at 100% and the resumption of religious services 
across the country. The country’s ports, airports and borders will 
continue to be closed until then, after which most of the measures are 
expected to be eased gradually. Public sector workers have been 
instructed to work on a rotational basis, and remote working has been 
encouraged as much as possible. In order to guarantee jobs provided by 
subcontracting companies in the textile industry, the Government 
authorized these factories to gradually resume their activities from 
April 20th, while respecting the measures to prevent the spread of the 
virus. These measures include, among others, the operation of the 
factories on rotating basis with only 30 percent of their workforce, 
measuring the temperature of the workers upon entry to the factory, and 
the obligation to wear facial masks. </p>

supporting wage payments temporarily in some sectors. Altogether, 
spending should increase by 4.0 percent of GDP, of which 2.3 percent of 
GDP on healthcare, 0.6 percent of GDP to protect vulnerable populations 
(including dry food rations) and 0.9 percent of GDP in other transfers.

<h3>Honduras</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 12, 2020. The government has declared a national state
 of emergency and adopted containment measures, including a nation-wide 
curfew and closing of national frontiers. The authorities have taken 
fiscal and monetary and macro-financial measures actions to respond to 
the healthcare and humanitarian crisis, protect employment and mitigate 
the impact on economic activity.
</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Honduras went into 
lockdown on March 16, with only essential services operating (food 
production and distribution, banks, pharmacies and production of medical
 supplies, energy, telecoms, and related transport activities). Access 
to retail grocery stores remains restricted by weekday according to last
 digit in ID numbers. Re-openings of non-essential activities started 
with hardware stores (April 16), restaurants for delivery (May 4), 
construction (starting May 11, sequenced by priority and size of 
projects), maquila sector (gradual reopening) and selected government 
services. Since June 8 the government is implementing a plan agreed with
 the private sector to gradually reopen all sectors by regions, aiming 
to reach full normalization of activities at different stages depending 
on the incidence of COVID by region. Out of 298 municipalities, 232 
without known cases of COVID started with 60% of workers, 53 
municipalities with limited incidence of COVID with 40% of workers, and 
13 with high incidence and population density (including the capital and
 main business hub San Pedro Sula) with 20%. The reopening of most 
municipalities with high incidence was delayed until August 3.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The authorities are deploying a well-targeted fiscal response to 
the pandemic while establishing strong transparency and accountability 
frameworks. In this context and following a request to Congress to make 
use of the emergency clause included in the Fiscal Responsibility Law 
(FRL), the authorities’ program initially envisaged a fiscal deficit of 
the Non-Financial Public Sector of 4 and 3 percent of GDP in 2020 and 
21—after 1 percent deficit in 2019 in line with the FRL, with additional
 borrowing by the government of $2.5 bn in 2020-21, about 10 percent of 
GDP in total. As the impact of the crisis deepened, the government 
submitted to Congress in September a revised request under the FRL 
escape clause for fiscal deficits of the NFPS of 5 and 4 percent of GDP 
in 2020-21. </p>
    <p>Efforts have concentrated on supporting the fragile health system
 and providing targeted support to families, workers, and firms. 
Additional crisis-related spending needs were initially estimated at 2.1
 percent of GDP in 2020, including emergency healthcare expenditures 
(0.9 percent of GDP), temporary unemployment benefits to formal workers 
(0.6 percent of GDP), delivery of food supplies to poor families (0.2 
percent of GDP), and cash transfers to informal workers (0.4 percent of 
GDP). The authorities have identified significant nonpriority spending 
reallocations to partly finance these emergency expenditures. Congress 
approved a decree authorizing expedited purchasing procedures for 
emergency expenditures related to the crisis.</p>
    <p>On the revenue side, Congress approved reduced advance payments 
in corporate income tax to provide cash flow relief to companies, as 
well as a temporary VAT exemptions for medical supplies. There is also a
 one-off income tax credit (10 percent of salary expenses) for companies
 maintaining pre-crisis employment levels. Congress also approved 
deferrals to the second half of 2020 and early 2021 for payments of 
income taxes and social contributions, favoring especially SMEs. VAT 
payments were also deferred for SMEs in non-essential sectors not 
operating during the curfew.  </p>
    <p>The government introduced temporary freezes in prices of goods in
 the basic consumption basket, as well temporary free access to 
emergency telecommunications services related to the Covid-19 
crisis—these measures do not have a budgetary cost. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Since the start of the pandemic, the central bank has cut the 
policy rate by 150 bps to 3.75 percent—following cumulative cuts of 50 
bps in December and January—and reduced the spread over the policy rate 
for its emergency lending facility (by 50 bps) and its repo operations 
(by 25 bps). The BCH also announced the suspension of liquidity 
absorption operations until end-June, and accelerated the implementation
 of previously announced elimination of obligatory investments in the 
central bank, providing estimated liquidity injection of L21,400 mn, 
about 3.5 percent of GDP. In September, the BCH reduced reserve 
requirements from 12 to 9 percent, while reintroducing temporary 
mandatory investments of 3 percent to incentivize new credits backed by 
the guarantee funds. </p>
    <p>Second-tier public development bank Banhprovi will provide L6,875
 mn (1.1 percent of GDP) in guarantees to cover potential losses on new 
loans to SMEs and other companies, with varying coverage of commercial 
banks' exposures on the loans covered by the guarantee scheme. The bank 
is also deploying additional L5,625 mn (0.9 percent of GDP) to finance 
loans to SME and other sectors affected by the pandemic. These guarantee
 and lending schemes will be funded with loans from the regional 
development bank CABEI. </p>
    <p>The government also issued a decree mandating all supervised 
financial institutions to provide temporary debt service relief to 
companies and individuals whose incomes have been affected by the 
crisis. Debt service of affected sectors was suspended until end-June, 
without penalties or impact on credit classification; at end-June, 
financial institutions were granted discretion to extend the grace 
period further depending on assessed debt service capacity of most 
affected households and corporates. The government also announced a 
3-month moratorium on service of bank loans financed by Banhprovi 
(covering about 5 percent of total bank credit to the private sector). </p>

<h3>Hungary</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first case of COVID-19 was reported 
on March 4, 2020. The economy has been hit hard by the outbreak as it is
 tightly intertwined globally through supply chains and tourism. The 
government declared a state of emergency on March 11 and implemented 
various containment measures, including travel and activity 
restrictions, and mandatory distance learning for schools and 
universities. On March 27, mandatory shelter-in-place in place was 
imposed, except for essential business and activities (e.g., food 
shopping, healthcare). </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Since May 4, the economy 
has been gradually reopening. Stores, malls, museums, churches, were 
allowed to reopen and outdoor seating is permitted in restaurants. 
Students returned to schools and daycares in June, and summer camps were
 open. Ordinary health services have restarted. Religious ceremonies as 
well as civil marriages and funerals can also be held. Sports may be 
conducted in closed doors and music and dance events with less than 500 
participants may be held. The state of emergency was lifted by June 18. 
Social distance rules are expected to still be heeded everywhere and 
masks are required in shops and public transport. However, border 
restrictions were reintroduced again on September 1 in response to the 
recent rapid rise in infections. Some of the emergency measures remain 
in place and the government may declare a health crisis for a period of 
up to six months (extendable indefinitely) without parliamentary 
authorization.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>A first wave of fiscal measures were introduced earlier in the 
epidemic, including, on the revenue side, measures to alleviate the 
fiscal burden on businesses: (i) employers' social contributions will be
 lifted in the most affected sectors; (ii) the health care contributions
 will be lowered through June 30; (iii) around 80,000 SMEs (mainly in 
the services sector) will be exempt from the small business tax (the 
payment of the tax by other companies in affected sectors will be 
deferred until the end of the state of emergency); (iv) the tourism 
development contributions will be temporarily cancelled; (v) media 
service providers will be given a tax relief for incurred losses of 
advertising revenue; and, (vi) procedures for collecting tax arrears 
will be suspended during the state of emergency. On the spending side, 
about HUF 245 billion (0.6 percent of GDP) was reallocated to the 
healthcare sector.</p>
    <p>On April 8, a new package of new measures was announced, 
supported by the creation two new funds, the Anti-Epidemic Protection 
Fund and the Economy Protection Fund. The latter Fund will be financed 
through new taxes on the private activity and reallocations from 
ministries and from the Employment Fund. Their spending targets (i) job 
protection, notably by subsidizing wages to companies on workers who 
were put on shortened work hours (with rules that were made more 
flexible on April 23); (ii) job creation by supporting investments worth
 a total of HUF 450bn; (iii) support for priority sectors, including 
tourism, health, food, agriculture, construction, logistics, transport, 
film and entertainment industries; (iv) provision of interest-subsidized
 and guaranteed credit facilities to Hungarian companies; (v) an extra 
week of pension will be paid out every February during 2021-24. On April
 16, the government introduced three new export support measures through
 the state-owned Eximbank: (i) EUR 800,000 grant for investments of 
export companies; (ii) preferential working capital loans, and (III) a 
new guarantee and insurance scheme. On April 23, a state-owned 
development bank MFB launched a HUF 1,490bn package of financial support
 instruments for companies, consisting of three loan products, two 
guarantee instruments and four capital programs. On May 7, the 
government announced it will purchase up to HUF 150 billion (0.3 percent
 of GDP) of bonds issued by banks in order to support lending during the
 crisis and to ensure financial stability. On May 20, the government 
announced a new wage subsidy program for new hires, with the condition 
for a company of keeping a worker for at least nine months. 
Interest-free loans to SMEs will be available from June 12. Half of the 
program’s budget will be available for investments, while the other 50 
percent is intended to finance liquidity and operations. The highest 
amount available for investments is HUF 150 million, while asset and 
liquidity financing loans are capped at HUF 300 million. On August 25th,
 the government announced that it will not be expanding the wage subsidy
 scheme as of end-August.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Since the start of the pandemic, the central bank (MNB) increased
 access to liquidity through: (i) an increase in the regular 
forint-liquidity swap stock at regular auctions; (ii) the introduction 
of the daily provision of one-week forint-liquidity swaps; (iii) the 
expansion of eligible collateral; (iv)&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mnb.hu/en/pressroom/press-releases/press-releases-2020/unlimited-amount-of-long-term-liquidity-available-at-fixed-interest-rates" target="_blank">the introduction of a long-term unlimited collateralized lending facility</a>; and (v) suspension of penalties for unmet reserve requirements. On April&nbsp;1<sup>st</sup>,
 it introduced a one-week deposit tender at the Lombard rate, which 
effectively tightened overall liquidity and eased depreciation pressures
 on the HUF. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mnb.hu/en/monetary-policy/the-monetary-council/press-releases/2020/press-release-on-the-monetary-council-meeting-of-7-april-2020" target="_blank">On April 7, the MNB announced</a>
 (i) a change in the overnight lending rate by 95 bps to 1.85 percent, 
making the interest rate corridor symmetric (with the overnight deposit 
rate at -0.05 percent; the base rate at 0.9 percent; and the overnight 
lending rate at 1.85 percent); (ii) an increase in the one-week lending 
rate to 1.85 percent; and (iii) the elimination of the target on the 
amount of the liquidity injection or withdrawal to give greater 
flexibility to monetary policy. On June 23 and July 21, the MNB reduced 
the base rate by 15 basis points each time, from 0.90 to 0.60 percent, 
while the interest rate corridor remained unchanged (-0.05 to 1.85 
percent). A quantitative easing program was also launched, consisting of
 buying government securities on the secondary market, and the mortgage 
bond purchase program is being re-started. On September 24, the MNB 
hiked the 1-week deposit rate by 0.15 percent to 0.75 percent in order 
to reduce inflationary pressures and currency depreciation. On 4 May, 
the MNB launched its government securities and mortgage bonds purchase 
program as a part of Quantitative Easing strategy to strengthen monetary
 policy transmission. On September 8, the MNB introduced a new 
forex-liquidity swap facility. The facility seeks to improve the 
effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and reduce the 
volatility of yields on the domestic forex swap market. </p>
    <p>On April 7, a new SME lending program was also announced (FGS 
GO!) with increased amounts and increase in the interest rate subsidy. 
On July 2, the MNB relaxed its conditions, including allowing the use of
 loans for investment abroad and loosening conditions for borrowing 
working capital loans. The corporate bond purchase program (BFGS) 
remained in place and maturities of eligible bonds were extended and 
amount per business group was increased. On September 22, MNB raised the
 amount available under the program to 750 billion forints from HUF 450 
bn previously. The MNB intends to sterilize liquidity injected through 
both the FSG GO! and BFSG programs through a preferential deposit 
facility bearing tiered interest rates up to 4 percent. </p>
    <p>Measures were also taken to provide financial relief to 
households and corporates borrowers, including: (i) the provision of a 
grace period of repayment of loans to the Growth Funding Facility 
(subsidized lending to SMEs supported by the MNB); (ii) the extension of
 short-term loans to businesses until June 30; (iii) a repayment 
moratorium on all existing loans, corporate and retail, until the end of
 this year, with a reprofiling of debt payment thereafter to avoid an 
increase in monthly payments; and, (iv) a cap on the average annual 
percentage rate (APR) on new unsecured consumer credit at the central 
bank base rate (currently, 0.9 percent) plus 5 percent. On September 20,
 the government extended debt repayment moratorium by six months for 
select groups.</p>
    <p>Regarding macro-prudential measures, (i) the Foreign Exchange 
Coverage Ratio (FECR), which imposes a limit on the difference between 
forex-denominated assets and liabilities of credit institutions as a 
percent of total assets, was reduced from 15 to 10 percent; and (ii) the
 additional capital buffer requirement for systemically-important banks 
will be temporarily eliminated as of July 1. On September 8, regulatory 
forbearance for unmet reserve requirements was reversed.</p>

<h3>Iceland</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> As a country dependent on tourism, 
Iceland has been highly exposed to health, economic, and financial 
contagion from the global spread of the COVID-19 virus. By September 24,
 86 percent of the 2512 domestic confirmed COVID-19 cases have 
recovered. Ten have died. The strategy to contain the disease has 
involved a national pandemic plan with significant focus on mass 
testing, contact tracing, and quarantines. The economic impact of the 
pandemic is partially being offset by Iceland’s use of its available 
policy space. GDP growth fell to -9.1 percent (y/y) in Q2 from a -1.2 
growth in Q1 (y/y).  </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Containment measures have 
been relaxed from their peak, but experienced bouts of tightening around
 infection flare-ups. In response to a recent increase in domestic 
infections, containment measures have been reintroduced, including 
lowering back the maximum size of social gatherings to 200 individuals, 
enforcing social distancing rules, and temporarily closing entertaining 
venues. Starting on August 19, to avoid a 14-day quarantine, passengers 
arriving to Iceland should take two COVID-19 tests in between a 5-day 
quarantine.  </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Three packages of fiscal measures have been approved by 
parliament to ease the strain on households and firms and, looking 
forward, to help the economy recover. Key measures to support households
 and firms include tax cuts, deferrals, and loss offsets; increased 
unemployment benefits, child allowances, quarantine grants, state 
contributions to firms’ dismissal costs to prevent bankruptcies of 
viable firms and protect workers’ rights; and state-guaranteed loans to 
companies. Key measures to restart the economy include public 
investment, tax incentives for real estate improvement, temporary tax 
relief for the tourism sector, and marketing efforts to encourage 
tourism in Iceland. On June 16, parliament approved simpler temporary 
rules for financial restructuring of companies.

    <li>
    <p>
    The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) has provided monetary support and 
has taken measures to preserve financial stability. Since the outbreak, 
the Monetary Policy Committee has cut policy rates by 175 basis points 
to 1 percent and reduced deposit institutions’ average reserve 
requirements to 1 from 2 percent to ease their liquidity positions (by 
about 1 percent of 2020 GDP). To increase liquidity in circulation, the 
CBI eliminated its intake of 30-day deposits. The CBI Financial 
Stability Committee reduced the countercyclical capital buffer from 2 
percent to 0 percent, providing scope for banks to increase lending by 
ISK 350 billion (12 percent of 2020 GDP).

<h3>India</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first case of COVID-19 in India was 
reported on 30 January 2020 and the number of cases continues to rise. 
Prime Minister Modi announced on March 24 that the entire country will 
go under lockdown, with localized lockdowns in containment zones 
extended to September 30. Prior to the March 24 announcement, numerous 
containment measures had already been imposed, varying in intensity 
across the country, including travel restrictions; closing educational 
establishments, gyms, museums, and theatres; bans on mass gatherings; 
and encouraging firms to promote remote work. The economic impact of 
COVID-19 has been substantial and broad-based. GDP contracted sharply in
 2020Q2 (-23.9 percent year-on-year) due to the unprecedented lockdowns 
to control the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On April 15, with a view 
to supporting economic activities, the government announced several 
relaxation measures in geographical areas designated as non-hotspot, 
with effect from April 20, 2020. On April 29, the government permitted 
inter-state movement of stranded people, including migrant workers, 
managed by the nodal authorities who are designated by the states. Some 
graded relaxations in economic activities have been allowed in 
geographic areas designated as orange and green zones on May 4 and 
domestic air travel restarted on May 25. On May 12, the PM announced a 
relief package of around 10 percent of GDP, including previously 
announced monetary and fiscal measures. On July 29, the central 
government issued ‘Unlock 3.0’ guidelines further paving the way for a 
phased re-opening of activities across the country and limiting the 
lockdown only to containment zones till August 31. On August 29, the 
government issued new guidelines (‘Unlock 4.0’) to further re-open the 
economy in September, removing restrictions on metro rail in a graded 
manner from 7 September, and allowing for social, academic, sports, 
entertainment, and other congregations of up to 100 people. Education 
institutions will remain closed till end-September, with lockdowns 
continuing to be implemented in containment zones.  </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>India’s fiscal support measures can be divided into two broad 
categories: (i) direct spending (about 1.7 percent of GDP) and foregone 
or deferred revenue (about 0.3 percent of GDP falling due within the 
current year); and (ii) below-the-line measures designed to support 
businesses and shore up credit provision to several sectors (about 4.9 
percent of GDP). The key direct-spending measures are: in-kind (food; 
cooking gas) and cash transfers to lower-income households; insurance 
coverage for workers in the healthcare sector; and wage support and 
employment provision to low-wage workers. An additional 150 billion 
rupees (about 0.1 percent of GDP) will be devoted to health 
infrastructure. Several measures to ease the tax compliance burden 
across a range of sectors have also been announced, including postponing
 some tax-filing and other compliance deadlines, and a reduction in the 
penalty interest rate for overdue GST filings.  Measures without an 
immediate direct bearing on the government’s deficit position aim to 
provide credit support to businesses (1.9 percent of GDP), poor 
households, especially migrants and farmers (1.6 percent of GDP), 
distressed electricity distribution companies (0.4 percent of GDP), and 
targeted support for the agricultural sector (0.7 percent of GDP), as 
well as some miscellaneous support measures (about 0.3 percent of GDP). 
Key elements of the business-support package are various financial 
sector measures for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises and 
non-bank financial companies, whereas additional support to farmers will
 mainly be in the form of providing concessional credit to farmers, as 
well as a credit facility for street vendors. Agricultural sector 
support is mainly for infrastructure development.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Since March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the 
repo and reverse repo rates by 115 and 155 basis points (bps) to 4.0 and
 3.35  percent, respectively, and announced liquidity measures across 
three measures comprising Long Term Repo Operations (LTROs), a cash 
reserve ratio (CRR) cut of 100 bps, and an increase in marginal standing
 facility (MSF) to 3 percent of the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), now
 extended till end-September and open market operations (including 
simultaneous purchases and sales of government securities), resulting in
 cumulative liquidity injections of 4.7 percent of GDP through August. 
The RBI has provided relief to both borrowers and lenders (now extended 
through end-August) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(SEBI) temporarily relaxed the norms related to debt default on rated 
instruments and reduced the required average market capitalization of 
public shareholding and minimum period of listing. The implementation of
 the net stable funding ratio and the last stage of the phased-in 
implementation of the capital conservation buffers were delayed by six 
months. On April 1, the RBI created a facility to help with state 
government's short-term liquidity needs, and relaxed export repatriation
 limits. Earlier, the RBI introduced regulatory measures to promote 
credit flows to the retail sector and micro, small, and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs) and provided regulatory forbearance on asset 
classification of loans to MSMEs and real estate developers (later 
extended to loans from NBFCs). CRR maintenance for all additional retail
 loans has been exempted, and the priority sector classification for 
bank loans to NBFCs has been extended for on-lending for FY 2020/21. 
During April 17-20, the RBI, along with additional monetary easing, 
announced: (a) a TLTRO-2.0 (funds to be invested in investment grade 
bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures of NBFCs); (b) 
special refinance facilities for rural banks, housing finance companies,
 and small and medium-sized enterprises; (c) a temporary reduction of 
the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and restriction on banks from making 
dividend payouts; (d) a standstill on asset classifications during the 
loan moratorium period with 10 percent provisioning requirement, and an 
extension of the time period for resolution timeline of large accounts 
under default by 90 days. Furthermore, state’s Ways and Means Advance 
(WMA) limits have been increased by 60 percent and the limit for the 
central government’s WMA for the remaining part of first half of the FY 
2020/21 has been revised up to 2.0 trillion. The RBI asked financial 
institutions to assess the impact on their asset quality, liquidity, and
 other parameters from the COVID-19 shock and take immediate contingency
 measures. On April 27, the RBI announced a special liquidity facility 
for mutual funds (SLF-MF) and a fixed-rate 90-day repo operation for 
banks exclusively for meeting the liquidity requirements of mutual 
funds, along with regulatory easing for liquidity support availed under 
the facility, later (April 30) extended to banks’ own deployed 
resources; and the SEBI reduced broker turnover fees and filing fees on 
offer documents for public issue, rights issue and buyback of shares. On
 May 13, the government announced measures targeting businesses: (i) a 
collateral-free lending program with 100 percent guarantee, (ii) 
subordinate debt for stressed MSMEs with partial guarantee, and (iii) 
partial credit guarantee scheme for public sector banks on borrowings of
 non-bank financial companies, housing finance companies (HFCs), and 
micro finance institutions. The government also announced (i) a Fund of 
Funds for equity infusion in MSMEs, and (ii) a special purpose vehicle 
(SPV) to purchase  short-term debt of the eligible non-bank financial 
companies and housing finance companies, fully guaranteed by the 
government and managed by a public sector bank. On May 22, the RBI 
undertook further regulatory easing, including the increase in the large
 exposure limit, relaxation of some of the norms for state government 
financing, credit support to the exporters and importers and extension 
of the tenor of the small business refinancing facilities. On June 4, 
the RBI extended the benefit under interest subvention and prompt 
repayment incentive schemes for short-term agricultural loans until 
August 31, 2020. On June 12, the GST council announced that it would 
halve the interest rate charged on overdue filings of small businesses. 
On June 21, the RBI directed banks to assignment zero percent risk 
weight on the credit facilities extended under the emergency credit line
 guarantee scheme. On August 6, RBI permitted banks to restructure 
existing loans to MSMEs classified as ‘standard” (as of March 1, 2020) 
without a downgrade in the asset classification. The restructuring of 
the borrower account is to be implemented by March 31, 2021. Banks are 
required to maintain additional provision of five percent over and above
 the provision already held by them for accounts restructured. The RBI 
also announced a resolution plan for corporate and personal loans that 
were classified as ‘standard’ as of March 1, 2020 but were stressed due 
to COVID-19. Resolution needs to be invoked by end-December 2020 and the
 eligible loans continue to be classified as ‘standard’ until the 
implementation of the resolution plan. Ten percent provisioning is 
required following the implementation of the resolution plan. On August 
31, banks are allowed to hold fresh acquisitions of SLR securities 
acquired from September 1, 2020 under held-to-maturity up to an overall 
limit of 22 per cent through March 31, 2021. On September 22, the 
Parliament adopted the amendment to the Indian Bankruptcy Code, with no 
insolvency cases until March 25, 2021.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On March 16, RBI announced a second FX swap ($2 billion dollars, 6
 months, auction-based) in addition to the previous one with equal 
volume and tenor. The limit for FPI investment in corporate bonds has 
been increased to 15 percent of outstanding stock for FY 2020/21. 
Restriction on non-resident investment in specified securities issued by
 the Central Government has been removed. Foreign direct investment 
policy has been adjusted requiring that an entity of a country that 
shares a land border with India can invest only after receiving the 
government approval.</p>

<h3>Indonesia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Indonesia reported its first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on March 2, 2020. The government adopted various 
containment measures, including temporary bans on domestic and 
international air and sea travel, screening at ports of entry, school 
closures, and other restrictions on public events. The government also 
banned Indonesia’s traditional annual exodus for Muslim holidays during 
Eid al-Fitr celebrations in May in an effort to curb the spread of the 
virus from Jakarta and other high-risk regions. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> In June, Indonesia began 
easing some containment measures. The city of Jakarta started a 
transitional phase from large-scale social restrictions on June 5th and 
further eased restrictions on malls (on June 15) and parks and 
recreation areas (on June 20). However, the city of Jakarta has extended
 the transitional phase from large-scale social restrictions through 
September 10 in the absence of a sustained decline in daily new virus 
cases. On September 9, Jakarta’s governor announced that large-scale 
social restrictions would be tightened further to contain the spread of 
the virus. </p>
<p>Indonesia’s growth further slowed in the second quarter of 2020 to 
-5.3 percent y/y (from 3 percent Q1:2020) or -25 percent q/q, s.a.a.r., 
mostly driven by reduced consumption and investment as containment 
measures led to disruptions to mobility and activity. External pressures
 eased in April and May, although some volatility remains. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>In addition to the first two fiscal packages amounting to IDR 
33.2 trillion (0.2 percent of GDP), the government announced an 
additional package of IDR 405 trillion (2.6 percent of GDP) on March 31,
 2020, which was further expanded to IDR 677.2 trillion (4.2 percent of 
GDP) on June 4, 2020, as part of a national economic recovery program. 
The fiscal packages comprise (i) support to the health care sector to 
boost testing and treatment capability for COVID-19 cases; (ii) 
increased benefits and broader coverage of existing social assistance 
schemes to low-income households such as food aid, conditional cash 
transfers, and electricity subsidy; (iii) expanded unemployment 
benefits, including for workers in the informal sector, (iv) tax 
reliefs, including for the tourism sector and individuals (with an 
income ceiling); and (v) permanent reductions of the corporate income 
tax rate from 25 percent to 22 percent in 2020-21 and 20 percent 
starting in 2022. In addition to tax and spending measures, the fiscal 
packages include capital injection into SOEs and interest subsidies, 
credit guarantees, and loan restructuring funds for micro, small, and 
medium enterprises (MSMEs).</p>

    <p>Bank Indonesia (BI) reduced the policy rate by 100 bps 
cumulatively in February, March, June, and July 2020, to 4 percent. BI 
also announced other measures to ease liquidity conditions, including: 
(i) lowering reserve requirement ratios for banks; (ii) increasing the 
maximum duration for repo and reverse repo operations (up to 12 months);
 (iii) introducing daily repo auctions; (iv) increasing the frequency of
 FX swap auctions for 1, 3, 6 and 12 month tenors from three times per 
week to daily auctions; and (v) increasing the size of the main weekly 
refinancing operations as needed. BI also adjusted <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bi.go.id/en/ruang-media/siaran-pers/Pages/sp_223020.aspx" target="_blank">macroprudential regulation</a>
 to ease liquidity conditions and support bond market stability. A 
Presidential decree has expanded BI’s authority to maintain the 
stability of the financial system in presence of the COVID-19 shock, 
including by facilitating BI liquidity assistance to banks, allowing BI 
to purchase government bonds in the primary market, and financing the 
deposit insurance agency (LPS) for bank solvency problems. The 
government and BI announced on July 6 a burden sharing scheme to help 
finance the economic response to the pandemic. The scheme, expected to 
be implemented only in 2020, covers (i) BI’s purchases of government 
bonds with coupons at the BI’s policy rate to finance priority spending 
on public goods such health and social protection; (ii) the budgetary 
interest cost of spending support to firms will be subsidized by BI 
transfers to the budget; and (iii) BI will act as buyer of last resort 
for long-term local-currency bonds to finance other spending. The 
government issued the first bond under the burden sharing scheme on 
August 6. BI is providing funding to LPS through repo transactions and 
purchases of government bonds owned by LPS. BI has also taken measures 
to further strengthen financial deepening, access to financial services,
 and monetary operations, including by facilitating collaboration 
between the banking industry and Fintech companies, supporting <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bi.go.id/en/ruang-media/siaran-pers/Pages/sp_224620.aspx" target="_blank">digital payment</a>
 in various sectors, and introducing Sharia-compliant instruments. To 
ease stock market volatility, the regulator OJK introduced a new share 
buyback policy (allowing listed companies to repurchase their shares 
without a prior shareholders’ meeting) and introduced <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.idx.co.id/en-us/news/press-release-detail/?emitenCode=1245" target="_blank">limits</a>
 on stock price declines. OJK has also relaxed loan classification and

<h3>Iran, Islamic Republic of</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Iran reported its first confirmed 
COVID-19 cases on February 19, 2020 in the city of Qom. After the 
outbreak, the government introduced a range of measures to limit the 
spread of the virus, including stopping flights from China, closing 
schools, malls, markets and key religious sites, and banning cultural 
and religious gatherings. On March 25, President Rouhani announced a 
partial lockdown, closing businesses and government offices for two 
weeks and banning travel between different cities. Accordingly, the 
Purchasing Managers’ Index in March and April collapsed.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Concerned about the 
economic damage from the outbreak, the government ordered a step-by-step
 reopening of businesses that it considered to be at low or average risk
 in terms of spreading the virus starting on April 8.  On April 27, Iran
 reopened all international borders to revive regional trade, while 
mosques and schools reopened in mid-May. On May 26 all businesses and 
major religious sites were opened. While the Purchasing Managers’ Index 
in May and June suggested that industries had started to recover, it 
registered a 6 percent contraction in July. </p>
<p><strong>Second wave: </strong>A “second wave” of virus cases is now 
hitting Iran which faces a shortage of medical personnel and hospital 
beds. Following this, the government has instituted mandatory 
mask-wearing and has announced new restrictions for one week in Tehran. 
Based on this order, all schools and universities, restaurants, cafes, 
cultural facilities and beauty salons will be closed and a third of 
government employees in Tehran will work remotely. More recently, 
President Rouhani said that a state of emergency to contain the 
coronavirus pandemic will remain in place at least until the end of 
January 2021.  </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>

<p>At the end of March President Rouhani announced around 10 percent of GDP in COVID-19 relief and recovery measures. </p>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Key measures include (i.) extra funding for the health sector (2 
percent of GDP); (ii.) cash transfers to vulnerable households (0.3 
percent of GDP); (iii.) support to the unemployment insurance fund (0.3 
percent of GDP); and subsidized loans for affected businesses and 
vulnerable households (4.4 percent of GDP). In addition, the government 
announced a moratorium on tax payments due to the government for a 
period of three months (6 percent of GDP).  Sukuk bonds, the National 
Development Fund and privatization proceeds will provide part of the 
financing.</p>
    <p>On April 15, the government embarked on its biggest-ever initial 
public offering, selling its residual shares in 18 companies (including 
12 percent share of Social Welfare Fund (SHASTA), the largest public 
company) to generate income as it struggles with the economic 
consequences of COVID-19 and U.S. sanctions. The estimated privatization
 proceeds are at around 165 trillion rials (0.6 percent of GDP) from 
banks and insurance companies and 70 trillion rials (0.2 percent of GDP)
 from SHASTA. On May 3, the government’s spokesman said that shares of  
four state-owned oil refineries will begin to be offered to the public 
soon.</p>
    <p>As of end of August, 13 percent of business applicants affected 
by the pandemic has received part of the aid package and 56.5 trillion

<h3>Iraq</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong>. The COVID-19 crisis intensified in Iraq 
over the summer. Iraq’s first confirmed case was on 22 February, however
 in the early weeks of the crisis the number of new cases was relatively
 contained. At the end of Ramadan in late May, the number of new cases 
escalated rapidly. The number of daily new cases continues to climb, and
 recently has averaged over 4000 cases a day. In the early stages of the
 crisis, the authorities implemented a range of measures to limit the 
spread of the virus, including closing borders, travel restrictions 
(including on international flights and internal public transportation),
 and closing schools and universities, however many of these measures 
have now been eased. A nationwide lockdown and curfew were first 
introduced on March 22. The curfew has subsequently been relaxed and at 
present a partial curfew is in place from 10 p.m.-5 a.m. daily. . In 
late June, the World Health Organization launched a COVID-19 awareness 
campaign, which is ongoing, focusing on education initiatives in high 
risk areas. In September, Iraq joined the COVAX Facility, a global 
initiative aiming to secure access to future COVID-19 vaccines. </p>
<p>The containment and mitigation measures will have a significant 
negative impact on non-oil activity, predominantly from 2020 Q2 onwards.
 Non-oil GDP is projected to contract significantly in 2020. In addition
 to the direct impact of COVID-19, the decline in oil prices has 
resulted in a sharp fall in oil revenues since the beginning of the 
year. Revenues are likely to remain low throughout the year, reflecting 
both a lower profile for oil prices and a decline in production, 
following the OPEC+ agreement. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On June 14, the curfew 
restrictions began to be eased, and a partial curfew is now in place. 
All land border crossings are now able to open for trade and airports 
reopened on July 23. Malls and shopping centers are permitted to reopen 
with the mandatory wearing of face masks and social distancing rules, 
restaurants and five-star hotels can resume operations, and sporting 
events can also take place without live audiences. Places of worship and
 parks are also permitted to reopen. There is, however, currently a ban 
on travelers entering Iraq for the purpose of tourism.  </p>

    <p>The Cabinet has directed the Ministry of Finance to provide an 
additional 50 billion Iraqi dinars ($42 million) from the contingency 
reserve to the Ministry of Health. To support the Ministry of Health's 
efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Bank of Iraq 
established a fund to collect donations from financial institutions 
which raised a total of $37 million, with initial donations of $20 
million from the Central Bank and $5 million from the Trade Bank of 
Iraq. The authorities have reduced spending in non-essential areas and 
have safeguarded budgetary allocations to the Ministry of Health. The 
Supreme Committee for Health and National Safety is introducing a cash 
transfer scheme, targeting the families of workers in the private sector
 that do not receive salaries or benefits from the government. Each 
eligible individual received 30,000 Iraqi dinars ($25), with a total 
cost of around 300 billion Iraqi dinars ($254 million).</p>

and principal payments by small and medium-sized enterprises through its
 directed lending initiative (the “one trillion ID” initiative) and 
encouraged banks to extend the maturities of all loans as they deem 
appropriate. More recently, the Central Bank has offered 5 million Iraqi
 dinars ($4200) of additional support to existing projects under the 
“one trillion ID” initiative and reduced the interest rates on loans 
extended through the scheme. The Central Bank also encouraged the use of
 electronic payments to contain the transmission of the virus, and

<h3>Ireland</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 1, 2020. The government has implemented a wide range 
of containment measures. On March 27, the government has issued strict 
restrictions on business activity, social distancing, and travel. Q2 
2020 GDP release surprised on the upside with only 3.7 percent decline 
year-on-year, supported by export growth and strong performance of 
pharmaceutical and IT sectors. High-frequency indicators in July and 
August point towards a robust pick-up in economic activity as the 
economy reopens. Tax collection for the first eight months surprised on 
the upside (a year-on-year decline of only 2.5 percent) indicating some 
upside risks for the fiscal outlook this year. August was the fifth 
deflationary month, with the CPI at -1 percent. Downside risks and 
uncertainty remain high, including due to disorderly Brexit. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On May 18, Ireland started
 a gradual reopening plan in five phases and progress was made up to 
phase 4, thanks to declining infection rate. The final phase was delayed
 due to the rebound in community transmission. Recently government 
adapted a medium-term national framework for living with Covid-19. It 
consists of five levels depending on the pandemic indicators, with lower
 level having less social restriction. Due to the sharp increase in new 
cases  Dublin was classified at level 3 last week, the rest of country 
is at level 2.  </p>

<h3>Israel</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Israel has been significantly affected 
by the global spread of COVID-19. The first case of COVID-19 was 
reported on February 21. The government has implemented a range of 
measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus, and to support
 people, jobs, and businesses. Measures in response to the COVID-19 
outbreak have included increased testing, travel restrictions, social 
distancing measures—including restricting Israelis to 100-meter radius 
of their home for recreation, and closures of businesses—except 
essential services—and indoor premises. The impact on economic activity 
has been large, with output declining (on an annualized basis) by 6.8 
percent in the first quarter and 29 percent in the second quarter of 
2020.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Starting on April 17, the 
authorities took gradual steps to ease containment measures by 
increasing the share of allowed employees in the workplace and reopening
 most stores. In May, the authorities also allowed schools to gradually 
open by the end of the month, eased movement and gathering restrictions.
 Malls opened early in the month, while restaurants towards the end of 
the month. The authorities have issued safety guidelines for distancing 
and sanitation in businesses and requiring the use of face masks in 
public places. On June 29, following a resurgence in morbidity, the 
authorities imposed new restrictions on gatherings and increased 
telework for public sector employees. This was followed by further 
restrictions in early July including on capacity use for restaurants and
 public transportation buses, closing bars and gyms. The authorities 
eased some restrictions in late July and early August. In early 
September, the government imposed a lockdown in several cities with high
 morbidity, followed by a nationwide lockdown in mid-September.</p>

<h3>Jamaica</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
registered on March 10, 2020. The government has taken early and 
proactive measures to contain the spread of infection across the island,
 including cancellation of all large public and private events, school 
shutdowns, quarantine of entire communities.  The daily curfews across 
the island remain in place, while the closure of the island’s borders to
 incoming visitors has been lifted for returning Jamaican citizens and 
non-citizens since June 1, and June 15 respectively.  The government has
 instituted protocols for arriving visitors, including pre-arrival 
documentation, in-airport screening and risk assessment, followed by a 
risk based approach to quarantine and movement limitations. The 
government has also issued guidelines on the reopening of beaches, 
rivers and theme parks, which are key tourism attractions. In addition,

announced to support the most affected sectors by the virus and contain 
labor shedding, including SCT and custom duty waivers on medical 
supplies and sanitizers and a COVID-19 Allocation of Resources for 
Employees (CARE) program, which envisages (i) temporary cash transfers 
to businesses in targeted sectors based on the number of workers 
employed; (ii) temporary cash transfer to individuals where loss of 
employment can be verified since March 10; (iii) grants targeted at the 
most vulnerable segments of society. The Minister also noted that the 
Fiscal Responsibility law contains an escape clause that would allow for
 some temporary flexibility in meeting the fiscal targets, should the 
economic situation deteriorate further. On May 13, the Ministry of 
Finance tabled in Parliament a Supplementary Budget for FY2020/21

<h3>Japan</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case in 
Japan was reported on January 16, 2020. In response to the outbreak, the
 authorities have taken several measures targeted towards health and 
containment efforts. Japan expanded entry bans on an additional 15 
countries as of April 29; as a result, this brings to a total of 90 
countries currently subject to Japan’s entry ban which will restrict the
 entry of foreigners who have visited COVID-19 affected countries and 
regions within the last 14 days. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared the 
state of emergency for seven prefectures (including Tokyo, Saitama, 
Kanagawa, Chiba, Osaka, Hyogo, and Fukuoka) on April 7 and expanded the 
coverage of the state of emergency to all Japanese prefectures on April 
16, effective through May 6. The state of emergency enabled prefectural 
governors in the designated areas to request people to stay at home, 
order closures of schools and public facilities, build temporary medical
 facilities, and adopt actions to support medical and food supplies. On 
May 4, PM Abe extended the nationwide state of emergency through May 31.
 The 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games have been postponed to July 23-August 8, 
2021.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Amid the declining trend 
of daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the beginning of May, the
 state of emergency was lifted for 39 prefectures out of a total of 47 
prefectures on May 14 and for Osaka, Kyoto, and Hyogo on May 21. On May 
25, the state of emergency was lifted for all prefectures, earlier than 
the previous May 31 expiry date. Restrictions on inter-prefectural 
travel were lifted on June 19. Following the recent rise in new 
infections, Tokyo raised the COVID-19 alert level to the highest on July
 15.  Amid that backdrop, it has requested residents to refrain from 
traveling outside Tokyo and karaoke venues and establishments serving 
alcohol to close by 10 p.m., until the end of August. As new infections 
continued to trend down, Tokyo lowered the alert level by one notch from
 the highest level on September 10 and would lift a measure that 
shortened hours for restaurants and karaoke from September 16. Regarding
 cross-border travel, Japan has resumed re-entry/entry into Japan by all
 foreign nationals who possess the status of residence. In addition, 
Japan started “Residence Track” with Thailand and Vietnam from July 29, 
which allows essential business exchange between the two countries, on 
condition they take preventive and quarantine measures, and also has 
agreed with Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia, Myanmar and Lao’s People’s 
Democratic Republic to introduce such scheme from early September.</p>

adopted the Emergency Economic Package Against COVID-19 of ¥117.1 
trillion (21.1 percent of 2019 GDP) and subsumed the remaining part of 
the previously announced packages (the December 2019 stimulus package 
(passed in January 2020) and the two COVID-19-response packages 
announced on February 13 and March 10 respectively). The April package 
aims at five objectives, including to: (i) develop preventive measures

(expenditure of 0.5 percent of 2019 GDP), (ii) protect employment and 
businesses (16.0 percent of 2019 GDP), (iii) regain economic activities 
after containment (1.5 percent of 2019 GDP), (iv) rebuild a resilient 
economic structure (2.8 percent of 2019 GDP), and (v) enhance readiness 
for the future (0.3 percent of 2019 GDP). The key measures comprise cash
 handouts to every individual and affected firms, deferral of tax 
payments and social security contributions, and concessional loans from 
public and private financial institutions.</p>
    <p>On May 27, the Government of Japan announced the second FY2020 
draft supplementary budget (passed on June 12). The package, worth 
¥117.1 trillion (21.1 percent of 2019 GDP), covers (i) health-related 
measures, (ii) support to businesses, (iii) support to households, (iv) 
transfers to the local governments, and (v) raising the ceiling of the 
COVID-19 reserve fund. The specific measures include expansion of the 
work subsidies, provision of subordinated loans by the public financial 
institutions to affected firms, and subsidies to affected firms for

largest contributor to the Fund’s concessional lending facilities. In 
early April, Japan pledged an additional US$100 million contribution to 
the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/16/49/Catastrophe-Containment-and-Relief-Trust" target="_blank">IMF’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust</a>
 as immediately available resources to support the Fund’s capacity to 
provide grant-based debt service relief for the poorest and most 
vulnerable countries to combat COVID-19. In order to provide emergency 
financing for broader emerging markets and developing countries to meet 
their prospective imminent needs, on April 16, Japan announced that it 
is aiming at doubling its contribution to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/IMF-Support-for-Low-Income-Countries" target="_blank">Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust </a>(PRGT)
 from the current SDR 3.6 billion. Japan made available the first SDR 
1.8 billion immediately. Japan calls on other member countries to follow
 quickly, and Japan will match an additional SDR 1.8 billion with their 
contributions. </p>

    <p>On March 16, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) called a monetary policy 
meeting and announced a comprehensive set of measures to maintain the 
smooth functioning of financial markets (notably of U.S. dollar funding 
markets), and incentivize the provision of credit. These include 
targeted liquidity provision through an increase in the size and 
frequency of Japanese government bond (JGB) purchases, special 
funds-supplying operation to provide loans to financial institution to 
facilitate financing of corporates, a temporary increase in the annual 
pace of BoJ’s purchases of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Japan-Real 
Estate Investment Trusts (J-REITs), and a temporary additional increase 
of targeted purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds. The BoJ 
has provided lending support through the special funds-supplying 
operation, and made purchases of Japanese government securities, 
commercial paper, corporate bonds, and exchange-traded funds.
    </p>
    <p>At its April 27 monetary policy meeting, the BoJ announced 
additional measures to maintain stability in financial markets and 
support credit provision. The BoJ decided to purchase a necessary amount
 of JGBs without setting an upper limit on its guidance on JGB 
purchases. In addition, it raised the maximum amount of additional 
purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds, lifting the upper 
limit of commercial paper and corporate bond holdings to ¥20 trillion 
(US$186 billion) in total. The special funds-supplying operations have 
been scaled up by expanding the range of eligible counterparties and 
collateral to private debt (including household debt), as well as by 
applying a positive interest rate of 0.1 percent to the outstanding 
balances of current accounts held by financial institutions at the BoJ 
that correspond to the amounts outstanding of loans provided through 
this operation. On May 22, the BoJ introduced a new fund-provisioning 
measure to support financing of mainly small- and medium-sized 
enterprises, providing funds against loans such as interest-free and 
unsecured loans made by eligible counterparties based on the 
government’s emergency economic measures.  The total size of the special
 funds-supplying operation and the new fund-provisioning measure amounts
 to about ¥90 trillion (US$838 billion).</p>
    <p>The BoJ in coordination with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of 
England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve and the Swiss 
National Bank enhanced the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity on March 
15, by lowering the pricing on the standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap 
arrangements by 25 basis points. Japan also has several important 
bilateral and regional swap arrangements with Asian countries.</p>
    <p>The government expanded the volume of concessional loan 
facilities (interest free without collateral) primarily for micro, small
 and medium-sized businesses affected by COVID-19 through the Japan 
Finance Corporation and other institutions. The government will also 
enhance access to loans with the same conditions from local financial 
institutions, such as local banks. To support borrowers during this 
period of stress, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) has reassured 
banks that they can assign zero risk weights to loans guaranteed under 
public guarantee schemes, draw down their regulatory capital and 
systemically important bank buffers to support credit supply, and draw 
down their stock of high-quality liquid assets below the minimum 
liquidity coverage ratio requirement. The FSA has also asked banks to 
defer principal payments on mortgage loans as needed, and refrain from 
charging fees for modifying mortgage loan conditions.
    </p>
    <p>On June 12, the Diet approved an amendment of the Act on Special 
Measures for Strengthening Financial Functions, which extends the 
deadline for regional banks’ application to government capital injection
 from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2026, and provides for relaxed 
application conditions for those regional banks affected by COVID-19. 
The Act aims to strengthen regional banks’ financial intermediary 
function through facilitating government capital injection to them. In 
addition, as precautionary measures, the Diet also approved the 
expansion of the limit of government guarantees for capital injections 
into regional banks from ¥12 trillion to ¥15 trillion.</p>

<h3>Jordan</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Jordan reported its first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on March 2, 2020. At the onset of the global epidemic, the
 authorities implemented a range of measures to try and limit the spread
 of the virus. Measures included the suspension of all international 
flights, the closure of all schools and universities, the closure of 
restaurants and archeological sites, the cancelation of all public 
events and gatherings, and quarantines. On March 17, the defense law was
 activated to enforce strict curfews, close businesses, and place 
restrictions on the movement of people within the country to counter the
 epidemic. The authorities also launched a public communication and 
awareness campaign to inform the public on examination and treatment 
facilities. The number of medical and nursing staff was increased in 
hospitals. The government has allowed only food and dairy industries and
 some export-oriented industries such as pharmaceuticals, potash and 
phosphates to continue some of their operations. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> A phased-out easing of the
 lockdown started on April 6, when factories located in industrial zones
 were allowed to resume operations. The re-opening of the economy 
continued through the month of April, with work partly resuming for 
selected sectors <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.royanews.tv/news/20767/2020-04-19" target="_blank">on April 21<sup>t</sup></a>, as well as most commercial activities on April 30. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/05/03/world/middleeast/03reuters-health-coronavirus-jordan-economy.html" target="_blank">On May 4</a>,
 Jordan lifted most lockdown measures and allowed most economic sectors 
to operate under strict safety guidelines. In late May 2020, the 
government allowed companies in hard-hit sectors to cut employees’ May 
and June salaries by 30%. The authorities announced that <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://petra.gov.jo/Include/InnerPage.jsp?ID=25698&amp;lang=en&amp;name=en_news" target="_blank">transport between governorates</a>
 would resume, night curfews would be shortened, hotels and cafes would 
be allowed to re-open, along with sporting events &nbsp;with no 
spectator effective June 6. Universities and schools remain closed and a
 curfew continues to be in effect at night. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/schools-reopen-september-1-pandemic-situation-determines-educational-pathway" target="_blank">On July 15</a>,
 the Ministry of Education announced that schools will reopen on 
September 1 for the new academic year. Strict distancing measures are 
still being implemented, with penalties imposed on establishments and 
individuals that do not adhere to public safety measures put in place to
 combat the spread of the virus. The Ministry of Health and local 
companies developed the “Aman” (“Safety”) application, which alerts 
users when they come into contact with someone who has COVID-19. The 
phased-out approach also entailed the complete restart of economic 
activities in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.royanews.tv/news/20765/2020-04-19" target="_blank">certain regions</a> that remained closed to the rest of the country. The government also started <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://safelyhome.gov.jo/" target="_blank">organizing</a>
 the return of Jordanians that were abroad at the onset of the crisis 
and had not been able to return given the interruption of international 
flights.The authorities will seek to capitalize on Jordan’s successful 
containment of the virus to enhance the Kingdom’s position as a regional
 hub for medical tourism and will offer assistance to countries in the 
region by providing pharmaceutical products and medical supplies. The 
authorities are also committed to further develop advanced agricultural 
and food processing industries and to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/king-says-jordan-should-be-regional-investment-hub-counter-covid-19-impact" target="_blank">spur regional cooperation</a>
 to shield the region from a potential food shortage crisis. On August 
13, Jordan closed its border with Syria due to virus concerns following 
an uptick in new cases. Following a recent uptick in COVID cases, the 
Government reinstated Friday curfews starting August 27 in Amman and 
Zarqa. On <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-jordan-airport/jordan-to-resume-regular-commercial-flights-from-sept-8-idUSL8N2FZ4D9" target="_blank">September 8</a>,
 Jordan re-opened airports for regular commercial flights with strict 
measures to contain the pandemic. Passengers from green-listed countries
 (low COVID cases countries) will be able to enter Jordan if they can 
prove they have resided for at least 14 days in the origin country, 
present a negative PCR test conducted less than 72 hours before 
departure and take another test at the airport in Jordan. Passengers 
from other countries will need to quarantine for 7 days and take another
 PCR test at the end of the quarantine. The Government enacted Defense 
Order 16 in mid-September, which introduced new measures designed to 
contain the pandemic (eg: limits to social gatherings) and includes 
strict penalties on people and businesses which do not comply with 
health safety measures (incl. fines, establishment closure and potential
 imprisonment).</p>
<p><strong>Relationship with the IMF</strong>: On May 20, 2020, the 
Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved 
Jordan’s request for emergency financial assistance under the Rapid 
Financing Instrument (RFI) equivalent to SDR 291.55 million (about US$ 
400 million, or 85 percent of quota). The purchase under the RFI is 
expected to cover part of Jordan’s financing needs stemming from the 
COVID-19 shock.</p>

<h3>Kazakhstan</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Kazakhstan reported its first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on March 14, 2020. A state of emergency introduced in 
mid-March to contain the spread of the coronavirus was lifted on May 11 
and followed by a gradual ease of quarantine measures. Quarantine 
measures were re-imposed in early July as the number of confirmed cases 
was trending up, and have only been gradually relaxed since late August 
following signs of stabilization of the COVID-19 situation. The 
authorities agreed with Russia to purchase the newly developed vaccine; 
Kazakhstan has also launched clinical trials for own-developed vaccine. 
Preliminary estimate suggests that overall growth in the first seven 
months was about -3 percent (yoy) due to weak activity in the service 
sector and the oil production cut required under the OPEC+ agreement. In
 March, the President announced a significant anti-crisis package (9 
percent of GDP), and further supportive measures were proposed in the 
presidential statement delivered in early September. Immediate policy 
actions have included trade restrictions and regulated prices for 
socially-important goods, cash transfers to vulnerable households, and 
targeted assistance to hard-hit sectors and small and medium-sized 
enterprises. Near- to medium-term plans include improving public 
administration through civil service reform, enhancing competitiveness 
in priority sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture, and adopting 
social policies to support the welfare of the population.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The authorities started to
 re-open the economy in mid-May. Enterprises in selected sectors were 
allowed to resume work with strong sanitary and epidemiological 
measures, including in the hospitality and transport services sectors. 
Restrictions on food exports introduced under the state of emergency to 
ensure domestic food supply were lifted on June 1. However, with the 
reintroduction of the quarantine regime in early July, the reopening was
 interrupted. Following the epidemy’s stabilization in late August, the 
authorities are now envisaging again a cautious reopening, as some 
quarantine measures started to be removed or relaxed in early September.
 Theatres and open-air cinemas have resumed operation under reduced 
occupation, and visitors are required to wear masks and comply with 
social distancing.  </p>

    <p>The anti-crisis package includes cash payments to the unemployed 
and self-employed, an increase in pension and social benefits, 
additional health spending, and support for employment and businesses. 
Subsidized lending of KZT 1 trillion (1½ percent of GDP) is being 
provided under the State Program “Economy of Simple Things,” along with 
actions to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) finance 
working capital (KZT 600 billion). KZT 1.8 trillion is allocated to 
support employment under an “Employment Roadmap” program, including some
 large-scale projects to modernize the transportation infrastructure. 
Selected enterprises and individual entrepreneurs are also eligible for 
new tax incentives. Further measures recently announced to restore 
economic growth include: a subsidized mortgage program for households 
with a segment targeting youth specifically, tax incentives to 
agriculture and hard-hit sectors (civil aviation, tourism), credit 
support to SMEs and manufacturing enterprises (the latter via a newly 
created industry development fund), and infrastructure development. 
Following the reintroduction of the quarantine in early July, the 
authorities provided additional cash transfers to individuals who lost 
their jobs due to the quarantine, lowered subsidized interest rates for 
SME loans (to 6 percent), and extended tax concessions for vulnerable 
individuals and businesses. </p>

    <p>The National Bank (NBK) raised its policy rate from 9.25 percent 
to 12 percent on March 10 after pressures on the tenge (KZT) intensified
 with the drop of oil prices. It cut the base rate to 9.5 percent in 
early April and further to 9 percent in July to support activity. To 
support banks and the economy, the authorities have, since the 
imposition of the state of emergency, (i) lowered risk weights (for SME 
from 75% to 50%, for FX loans from 200% to 100%, and for syndicated 
loans from 100% to 50%); (ii) expanded the list of eligible collaterals;
 (iii) lowered capital conservation buffer (by one percentage point); 
(iv) reduced the liquidity coverage ratio requirement (from 80% to 60%),
 and (v) lowered limits on foreign currency positions. To support the 
population and SMEs, the authorities have encouraged banks and other 
lenders to grant loan repayment deferrals to eligible borrowers, and to 
freeze their loan classifications at the pre-COVID-19 status. Most of 
these measures are expected to be in place for at least six months, with
 some (e.g., capital conservation buffer) extending to mid-2021. Cash 
withdrawals limits have also been temporarily imposed on legal entities 
starting early June. The financial supervisor recently revoked the 
license of a medium-sized bank which failed to meet the minimum capital 
requirement.</p>

    <p>The NBK allowed the tenge to depreciate by over 15 percent to

 It also introduced a limit on bid-ask spread and lowered the ceiling of
 FX purchase without supporting import documents for the duration of the
 state of emergency. The tenge partially recovered in April, but 
pressures re-emerged in the summer, triggered by increased uncertainty 
associated with the spread and impact of the pandemic, and by oil price 
volatility. In recent months, the NBK has ceased FX interventions 
(though it continues to sell FX on behalf of the national oil fund) and 
international reserves have increased, driven by the rising gold price.</p>

    <p>On March 24, President Moon announced a financial stabilization 
plan of KRW 100 trillion (5.3 percent of GDP). The main elements are: 1)

small merchants, mid-sized firms, and large companies (the latter on a 
case-by-case basis) including emergency lending, partial and full 
guarantees, and collateralization of loan obligations; 2) a bond market 
stabilization fund to purchase corporate bonds, commercial paper, and 
financial bonds; 3) financing by public financial institutions for 
corporate bond issuance through collateralized bond obligations and 
direct bond purchases; 4) short-term money market financing through 
stock finance loans, BOK repo purchases, and refinancing support by 
public financial institutions; and 5) an equity market stabilization 
fund financed by financial holding companies, leading financial 
companies, and other relevant institutions.
    </p>
    <p>On April 22 additional measures were announced totaling KRW 25 
trillion (1.3 percent of GDP), mainly through creation of a special 
purpose vehicle to purchase corporate bonds and commercial paper (KRW 10
 trillion) and additional funds for SME lending (KRW 10 trillion).
    Financing support to exporters and specific industries has also been
 announced. On April 8, a package of measures totaling KRW 36 trillion 
(1.9 percent of GDP) was announced to ease financing constraints for 
exporters, including increasing the amount and maturity of trade credit 
and expanding trade insurance. On April 22, President Moon announced a 
key industry stabilization fund would be established for KRW 40 trillion
 (2.1 percent of GDP) and operated by Korea Development Bank to support 
seven key industries: airlines, shipping, shipbuilding, autos, general 
machinery, electric power, and communications. Funds will be raised by 
issuance of government-guaranteed bonds and contributions of private 
funds. Support will be provided through loans, payment guarantees, and 
investments. As conditions for accessing support, businesses will be 
required to maintain employment, limit executive compensation, 
dividends, and other payouts, and share benefits from business 
normalization in the future.

    Other measures taken pertaining to financial market stability 
include expansion of BOK repo operations to non-banks, creation of a BOK
 lending program to non-banks with corporate bonds as collateral, a

<h3>Kyrgyz Republic</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has been hitting 
the economy very hard and created an urgent balance of payments need. 
The first confirmed case was reported on March 18, 2020. Recently, the 
epidemiological situation has improved, and new COVID-19 cases has been 
on downward trajectory. All sectors are being impacted with extreme 
severity as measures are being taken to stop the spread of the virus. 
The authorities have taken drastic measures to prevent the outbreak, 
including the closure of borders with China where 36 percent of imports 
of goods originate, border restrictions with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, 
the quarantine of people coming from abroad, a lockdown of all 
non-essential activities, and a curfew. As a result, tax revenue has 
declined substantially. At the same time, the weakening of oil prices 
has resulted in a decline in economic activity in Russia and a fall in 
remittances from Kyrgyz workers in that country. The state of emergency 
ended on May 10 and the curfew was lifted, while the quarantine regime 
will work until the stabilization of the epidemiological situation.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong>  The state of emergency 
ended on May 10 and the curfew was lifted, while the quarantine regime

Large shopping centers and public transport have opened on May 21, and 
May 25, respectively. All activities in the economic and social spheres 
have resumed from June 1, 2020, with some restrictions on cultural, 
sports, and family events; entertainment activities, and preschool 
activities. Domestic flights and public transport between the regions of
 Kyrgyz Republic resumed on June 5. International flights resumed on

    <p>The authorities will safeguard health spending at around budgeted
 levels and create space for increasing health and other spending. In 
collaboration with international organizations, the authorities have 
recently adopted a health sector contingency plan, with an estimated 
cost of $16 million (0.2 percent of GDP) to provide training for 
health-care workers, procure personal protective equipment and medical 
tests, and to put in place a communication plan about measures to 
contain COVID-19. To mitigate the impact on the economy, the authorities
 have approved the first package of anti-crisis plan economic measures 
of $15 million (0.2 percent of GDP) including the postponement of tax 
payments, time-bound exemptions of property and land taxes, and 
temporary price controls on 11 essential food items. They prepared a 
second and, more recently, a third package of economic measures of about
 $540 million (7 percent of GDP), including temporary tax exemptions for
 SMEs, support food security program to the vulnerable groups, and 
subsidized credit to banks to provide funding to small and medium-size 
enterprises through soft loans. The implementation of containment 
measures has caused 17.4 percent (y-o-y) drop in tax revenue in H1 2020,
 which will lead to a temporary widening of the budget deficit. The 
authorities are seeking donor financial support to close the financing 
gap.  On March 26, the IMF Board agreed to provide $121 million in 
emergency financial support to the Kyrgyz authorities. On May 8, the IMF
 Board approved $121 million, the second emergency assistance to the 
Kyrgyz Republic since the outbreak of the pandemic. The Kyrgyz 
authorities received budget assistance of $50 million from the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) on June 10.     </p>

    <p>The government has announced a support package of about €3.4 
billion (12 percent of projected 2020 GDP) covering several sectors of 
the economy: i) the largest package focuses on relief to businesses 
directly affected by the crisis in the form of loans and guarantees 
amounting to €1.2 billion, ii) a sectoral support package of €875 
million covering the air and transport industry, health and education 
sectors as well as infrastructure projects, iii) use of EU funds 
amounting to about €763 million to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 
crisis, iv) revenue measures amounting to about €331 million, and v) 
expenditure measures supporting idle workers and social benefits 
amounting to €196 million. The government will also contribute €50 
million to the €100 million investment funds established to support 
large enterprises affected by the crisis. These measures are partly 
financed by the issuance of €1.5 billion Eurobond and some expense 
saving from the budget (amounting to €4.4 million). The government has 
also signed a 10-year €500 million COVID-19 mitigation loan from the 
Nordic Investment Bank.  Latvia could receive nearly €10.5 billion in 
2021-2027 from Next Generation EU if the plan is approved by the 
European Parliament and national parliaments.</p>

<h3>Lebanon</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Lebanon’s underlying economic situation 
is challenging, with high public debt, current account deficit, and 
funding needs. The spread of COVID-19 is contributing to the economic 
recession. Lebanon reported its first confirmed COVID-19 case on 
February 21, 2020. The authorities have implemented a range of measures 
to try and limit the spread of the virus encompassing a general 
mobilization until August 2, 2020 with compete closure of all private 
sector and public institutions through May 24, 2020; educational 
establishments have been closed for the rest of the school year. Lebanon
 also closed the airport—after suspending flights from 11 countries—as 
well as seaports and land borders and completed the implementation of 
the first phase of the plan to repatriate Lebanese citizens wishing to 
return to Lebanon from various countries; the second phase started on 
April 26, 2020. As at July 1, 2020, Lebanon had completely opened up all
 sectors and resumed airport activity at 10 percent capacity. However, a
 significant surge in infections over the past month forced the 
government to announce a general lockdown for all public and private 
sector from July 30 through August 3 and from August 6 to August 10. 
Authorities then announced a two-week closure from August 21 to 
September 7 following a significant spike in daily cases and a record 
one-day deaths number; and extended the general mobilization until end 
2020. In addition, the government started imposing stricter quarantine 
measures on incoming travelers. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On April 24, 2020 a 
five-phase plan was approved to gradually ease the general mobilization 
in a manner that takes into consideration potential risks within the 
categories of different economic activities. The five-phase plan, now 
complete, opened up the different economic sector over a period of five 
weeks and culminates in the resumption of full economic activity and the
 resumption of air travel by July 1, 2020, with 10 percent of the 
airport’s capacity—2000 travelers a day. However, two weeks into the 
gradual easing, and with the continued repatriation of expats, infection
 cases spiked. Consequently, the government reinstated a full lockdown 
for the period May 14-18, 2020. It then announced resumption of the plan
 to gradually reopen the economy. The government very recently decreased
 curfew hours and is  heading towards a complete opening up of sectors. </p>

country was relaxed since May 5 Private businesses (non-essential) 
gradually reopened but some (e.g., alcohol) followed WHO’s 
recommendations. Public servants started going back to work but work in 
shifts and practice social distancing. The lockdown was lifted on May 
19, albeit with compulsory use of masks in public spaces and 
restrictions in high risk sectors such as tourism, sit-in restaurants, 
entertainment and assembly of more than 50 people. Schools have reopened
 gradually under the guidance of ministry of education.</p>

<h3>Liberia</h3>
<p>Liberia continues to experience rapid growth in the total number of 
confirmed cases of COVID-19, but from a small base. The cases are 
concentrated in Montserrado county (which includes Monrovia) but 
incidences are now reported in all other counties as well. The first 
case was detected on March 16, 2020.</p>
<p>On March 21, 2020 the Liberian authorities issued a declaration 
designed to enforce severe social distancing, including: closure of all 
schools, night clubs, cinemas, beaches, spas, mosques and churches; 
banning of all street selling and gatherings of more than 10 people; 
limits on admittance to banks and restaurants to five customers kept six
 feet apart; Social distancing for health facilities and pharmacies 
(which remained open); mandatory washing with soap and clean water at 
all public and private establishments; and a hotline was established to 
report those exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>On midnight April 10, Government announced and began enforcing a 
State of Emergency, which was subsequently approved by the Legislature 
as required in the Constitution. This was extended in early July, but 
with a downward adjustment in the curfew. Also mandated were the strict 
enforcement of wearing face masks in public, the observance of 
reasonable social distancing, and other approved health protocols, along
 with the re-opening of the international airport. The State of 
Emergency at mid-night on July 21, officially expired with no renewal. 
The immediate withdrawal of the military from various places of 
assignments across the country to the barracks was ordered by the 
President. The troops had been deployed across the country to assist 
with the rigid enforcement of the execution of the State of Emergency. 
With the expiration of the State of Emergency, Residents have been 
admonished to strictly adhere to the National Public Health Law and 
amended anti-COVID-19 protocols. The measures includes the continued 
closure of all night clubs and bars, Compulsory testing of outbound and 
inbound passengers using the international airport, the adaptation of a 
no face mask no service at all public places, and the increase in the 
admittance to banks service areas from five to ten with the observation 
of a three feet social distance.  Meanwhile, public sector workers 
considered non-essential placed on administrative pay leave as a result 
of the outbreak, are yet to be recall to work. Line ministries and 
agencies are currently operation on their approved essential staff.</p>
<p>In accordance with pronouncements from the Ministry of Education, 
in-person classes for students from 6 – 11 grades have resumed at on 
schools. 12 graders who returned to classes in early August are 
currenting sitting the regional West African high School Exams. Students

<p>The International airport on July 28, resumed international flights 
with the expiration of the State of Emergency. Anti COVID-19 protocols 
and procedures have been put in place by the management of the airport 
in consultation with health authorities, including presenting the 
certificate of a negative test or undergoing a rapid test on arrival.</p>
<p>The Legislature has approved the request by the Executive to allocate
 US$25 million—to be supplemented by US$5 million of donor funds—for a 
World Food Programme-implemented food distribution to the most 
vulnerable citizens, and this program is now being implemented.</p>
<p>The World Bank approved about US$17 million of off-budget project 
funding for the health sector, of which US$7.50 million was new 
investment financed by the COVID-19 Fast Track Facility (March 23); and 
$9.5 million was temporarily diverted from existing projects (March 30).

 approved US$14 million direct budget support for Liberia as part of a 
multi-country COVID-19 response to help bolster the fight against the 
pandemic. The funding is expected to be tailored largely towards 
financing vulnerable female-headed household and school-going children. 
Other targeted beneficiaries include the business community and small 
and medium-size enterprises. Other donors are also contributing, but 
funding shortfalls remain.</p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of August 27, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Aside from some measures to speed up and facilitate the 
importation process—including by removal of the pre-shipment inspection 
requirement and some protective surcharges, the inclusion of some 
COVID-19-related expenditure in the recast budget for the last fiscal 
year and to develop a preparedness plan—no other special fiscal measures
 have yet been adopted.</p>
    <p>The authorities are hoping to finalize a COVID-19 preparedness 
plan in conjunction with the donor community, and the draft is still 
evolving. The World Bank has to date disbursed over half of its 
available funding for actions under the plan. </p>
    <p>
    Areas of concentration under the plan include support to health care
    workers, purchase and rehabilitation of health care equipment, procurement
    of drugs and other medical supplies, deployment of surge staff to contact
    tracing activities, border areas, rapid response teams, training of
    responders, planning, communications and information sharing, staffing and
    equipping of laboratories, and logistical and supply support.
    </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p> The central bank reduced the policy rate by 500 bp to 25 percent
 partly to support increased financial intermediation. To mitigate the 
shortage of Liberian dollar banknotes, the CBL is expediting the 
procurement of additional banknotes to help meet the Liberian dollar 
demand in the economy. In response to the difficulties being felt by the
 private sector, the CBL is also allowing banks to practice limited 
forbearance on asset classification, provisioning, and lending policies 
in hard-hit sectors of the economy, while remaining vigilant for signs 
of banking sector stress.</p>
    <p>
    On the payments side, to better facilitate the use of electronic
    payments, the CBL has suspended fees and charges for most electronic
    transfers and point-of-sale outlets used by merchants and mobile money
    operators; and increased allowable daily limits. The bank has also
    increased the allowable daily and aggregate limits for mobile money
    transactions for a period of three months.

<h3>Libya</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong>. Libya reported its first COVID-19 
positive case in late-March 2020, when an infected man returned from a 
trip to Saudi Arabia via Tunisia.</p>
<p><strong>Infections and deaths from COVID-19 have increased exponentially since end-May 2020</strong>.
 As of September 23, 2020 the Tripoli-based National Center for Disease 
Control (NCDC) reported that Libya had close just over 30,000 positive 
COVID 19 cases. This number has roughly doubled since the beginning of 
September and continues to grow exponentially. More recently, the weekly
 reported confirmed cases in Libya have surpassed those of neighboring 
Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia, which all have much larger populations. The
 NCDC also reported that some 470 patients have died from COVID 19 
related complications thus far, up from just 3 deaths at end-May, and 
210 deaths at end-August. According to the NCDC, the outbreaks appear to
 most severe in Tripoli, Misrata and the southern desert town of Sebha, 
although cases have also been confirmed in most other major population 
centers. Notwithstanding the steep rise in positively identified 
Coronavirus cases and deaths in recent weeks, the true spread of the 
disease in Libya is considered to be significantly understated because 
of continued hostilities and restricted access to testing across the 
country, as well as limitations in data compilation. The NCDC continues 
to implement strict measures to contain the spread of the Coronavirus 
into and within Libya, but the fighting and migrating militias and 
civilians pose a challenge. Effective Friday, July 31, the Government of
 National Accord (GNA) imposed a near-total lockdown for at least five 
days, forbidding all movement outside the home except to buy 
necessities, thereby replacing a partial 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. On 
August 26, a new 4-day total curfew was declared by the GNA. It will be 
followed by a ten-day night curfew during from Sunday through Thursday 
that will start at 9.00 pm and go through 6.00 am the following day. The
 24-hour curfew will remain in effect on Fridays and Saturdays. The 
country’s borders have been closed, large public gatherings banned, and 
travel restrictions instituted, including between cities. Meanwhile, the
 GNA has repatriated Libyan citizens stranded in other hotspots in the 
region. </p>
<p>On March 29, the GNA freed some 470 inmates from local and regional 
prisons to reduce the risk of COVID 19 infections in Libyan detention 
centers. Also, on March 29, it was announced that all court proceedings 
would be suspended until the end of April. The authorities in the 
Eastern region of the country have ordered a dusk-to-dawn curfew. In the
 week of April 6, they also reported their first positive COVID 19 case 
of a patient who had returned from travel to Tunis. </p>
<p>So far, the continued civil war has had a severe social and economic 
impact than COVID-19. Libya’s economy is contracting sharply because of 
the steep drop in oil prices and the collapse of oil production of more 
than 90 percent due to the conflict. In August, the central bank 
reported that during the first seven months of 2020, the government lost
 US$8 billion in oil exports proceeds due to the stoppage of oil 
production and exports. Water supply to Tripoli and surrounding areas 
that was shut off in early April as a result of the ongoing fighting has
 since been restored. The combination of civil war and an accelerating 
pandemic could prove devastating. In response, the United Nations has 
renewed its calls for a ceasefire to address this extraordinary threat 
to the health and safety of the Libyan people. Meanwhile, fierce 
fighting continues in and around the central coastal city of Sirte 
between militias supporting the GNA and Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar’s 
forces, with a further intensification of hostilities expected in the 
coming few days and weeks. On August 6, the US Treasury Department 
imposed sanctions on three Libyans and a Malta-based company, accusing 
them of acting as a network to smuggle drugs and Libyan fuel into Malta 
and thereby contributing to instability in Libya. On August 21, the Head
 of the GNA (in the West) and the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives (in the East) announced an immediate ceasefire after 
intensive diplomatic mediation by Germany, the United States and Egypt. 
It is, however, not clear whether the ceasefire will hold, because it 
has been rejected by Haftar who declared that he is not bound by it. 
Meanwhile, social conditions in Tripoli and other major cities have 
continued to deteriorate considerably, with frequent and prolonged 
disruptions in the supply of water, electricity, and fuel. Widespread 
demonstrations of frustrated civilians in Tripoli have reportedly been 
met by harsh force, arrests and kidnappings. </p>

<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>In the spring of 2020, the Government of National Accord (GNA) 
announced a package of LD 500 million (about 1 percent of GDP) in 
emergency COVID-19 related spending. While the exact nature and use of 
this spending was not specified, it was believed to be aimed at 
supporting the health system in expanding testing and responding to a 
possible surge in infections. In early August, the Central Bank of Libya
 (CBL) stated that, to date, the actual total amount of funds approved 
by the Ministry of Finance to combat the Coronavirus pandemic had 
reached LD 847 million, of which LD 562 million were allocated to the 
Ministry of Health. In addition, about LD 50 million were allocated to 
municipalities and local councils, about LD 95 to the military for 
medicines and medical equipment, and about LD 41 million to Libyan 
embassies and consulates overseas. Certain medical equipment and 
personal protective gear are already in short supply as a result of the 
civil war which has impacted imports and impeded the free flow of goods 
within Libya’s borders. In an effort to protect declining reserves, in 
mid-April the GNA announced a 20 percent pay cut for civil servants. </p>

<h3>Luxembourg</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Luxembourg reported its first confirmed 
case of COVID-19 on February 29, 2020. In response to the outbreak, the 
government has taken a wide range of health and containment measures to 
curb the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable groups, including 
closures of schools and non-essential businesses, strict social 
distancing measures, and increase in testing capacity. Furthermore, the 
government declared a state of emergency, providing it with additional 
powers to quickly take decisions, and adopted a large fiscal stimulus 
package to bolster the resources for the health system and help maintain
 businesses and jobs. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On April 15, the government announced a <em>multiphase lockdown exit strategy</em>,
 with phases comprising activities/tentative opening dates as follows: 
phase 1—construction sites and selected activities—including craft, 
landscaping, and recycling services (April 20); phase 2—secondary 
education and vocational training, retail stores, beauty salons, museums
 and libraries, drive-in movie theaters, outdoor sports activities, and 
outdoor gatherings of up to 20 people, subject to strict safety measures
 such as mandatory wearing of face masks and maintaining physical 
distance (May 4–11); phase 3—basic education and childcare facilities, 
with classes alternating weekly attendance in school, and increasing 
public transport’s capacity (May 25); phase 4—selected activities in the
 hospitality sector (bars, cafes and restaurants), and public gatherings
 of more than 20 people (including sport and cultural venues, movie 
theaters, weddings, funerals and protests), subject to mandatory safety 
measures (May 29); phase 5—outdoor playgrounds and summer activities for
 children (June 13–15); later phases—commercial and event activities.</p>
<p>To achieve <em>a well-sequenced lifting of the lockdown restrictions and avoid a second wave of Covid-19 infections</em>,
 the government envisages to perform large-scale testing on a voluntary 
basis, including cross-border commuters. The testing strategy consists 
of segmenting the population into different contingents (starting with 
high school students and teachers) with people that have tested positive
 being isolated, and their contacts traced and quarantined. The 
government has been distributing free face masks to residents and 
cross-border workers.On June 22, the Parliament adopted <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites/toutes_actualites/communiques/2020/06-juin/24-ms-lois-covid19.html" target="_blank">two Covid-19 laws</a> that define the <em>legal framework</em>,
 including for mandatory protective measures, to be applicable after the
 expiration of the state of emergency on June 24. On July 16, the 
Parliament adopted the new Covid-19 law that combines and replaces two 
previous laws. The key additions include: (i) mandatory face masks for 
both public and private gatherings of more than 20 people in case 
physical distance of 2 meters cannot be guaranteed and (ii) fines for 
customers of bars and restaurants if they disregard the precautionary 
measures. On July 19, the Parliament adopted the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites/toutes_actualites/communiques/2020/07-juillet/19-mesures-covid.html" target="_blank">bill</a>
 introducing a series of pandemic control measures. The key measures 
include: (i) limiting the number of house guests to 10 people; (ii) 
making gatherings of more than 10 people subject to minimum distance and
 seating requirements, otherwise wearing a mask is compulsory; (iii) 
introducing fines for non-compliance with isolation or quarantine 
measures ranging from EUR 25 to EUR 500; and (iv) withdrawing of the 
establishment license for a period of three months in an event of 
repeated failure to comply with preventive measures by businesses in 
hospitality sector.</p>
<p>On September 4, the government announced a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites/toutes_actualites/articles/2020/09-septembre/04-meisch-rentree.html" target="_blank">plan</a> for <em>school reopening</em>, including more autonomy for schools to implement specific measures depending on the local health situation.</p>
<p>On September 22, the government adopted the Covid-19 law extending 
restrictive measures until December 31, 2020 and introducing new 
measures that include: (i) reducing the isolation period for people with
 confirmed Covid-19 infections to 10 days; (ii) allowing the processing 
of personal data that will be kept for a period of three months and then
 anonymized; and (iii) making it mandatory for airlines to automatically
 transfer to health authorities forms completed by passengers to 
facilitate contact tracing.</p>

    <p>The Luxembourg authorities have intensified off-site oversight of
 key risks in the banking sector and stepped up surveillance of 
investment funds, including new requirements for weekly updates on 
financial data, notifications on significant events and large 
redemptions, and fund managers’ governance arrangements. They introduced
 a draft law which, among others, grants the supervisory bodies powers 
to extend, for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis, reporting deadlines 
for entities under their remit. In line with the ECB’s recommendation on
 dividend distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic, banks were advised 
to refrain from distributing accumulated profits should this constrains 
their capacity to meet their clients’ credit and liquidity needs. They 
also issued guidance on COVID19-related financial crime and AML/CT 
issues, and released <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.cssf.lu/fileadmin/files/FAQ/FAQ_Covid_19_fr.pdf" target="_blank">Q&amp;As</a>
 clarifying, among others, reporting requirements for investment funds, 
and the prudential treatment of Covid-19 industry-wide private moratoria
 as well supervisory flexibility to avoid IFSR9-related procyclical 
effects for banks. Also, Luxembourg banks committed to offer a 6-month 
moratorium on loan repayment for SMEs, self-employed and liberal 
professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Madagascar</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Madagascar’s macroeconomic outlook has 
been affected by weaker external demand, the increased spread of the 
pandemic, and significant losses of revenue. The first confirmed cases 
were reported on March 20, 2020. The authorities continue to implement 
mitigation measures to accommodate the impact of the pandemic to ensure 
the health of the population and preserve macroeconomic stability. The 
national state of emergency first declared on March 23, has been 
extended several times. Following the activation of their national 
contingency plan, the authorities are taking measures to increase health
 spending, help the most vulnerable, support the private sector, and 
preserve the stability of the financial sector. In support of these 
measures, a multisectoral and interdisciplinary coordination unit 
Covid-19 Operational Command Center (CCO) was established at central, 
regional and local levels.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> While the curfew is still 
maintained in the capital city (the epicenter of the pandemic), it has 
been relaxed elsewhere, including with the extension of opening and 
closing hours for small businesses, and some resumption of public 
transportation, including limited domestic flights. On September 6, 
2020, the authorities announced the gradual resumption of national and 
regional transportation. Bans on international travel were maintained.</p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Key measures include: (i) targeted investments to strengthen the 
health system following the activation of the national contingency plan 
in coordination with the WHO to protect against the pandemic; (ii) 
expansion of social assistance to the most vulnerable, including 
cash-transfers and in-kind necessities to the poorest and those 
unemployed; and (iii) supporting private sector through tax relief, 
suspension of government fees and waived social contributions. As of end
 of July,  medicine and medical equipment were exempted from paying 
import duties.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>•   The central bank provided monetary policy support and acted 
to safeguard financial stability. The central bank is providing 
liquidity to the commercial banks, reaching MGA 442 billion (about 0.8 
percent of GDP) at end June 2020 and relaxed some mandatory deposit 
limits to encourage banks to defer delayed payments on existing loans 
and increase lending to businesses.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The authorities are maintaining the flexible exchange rate 
regime. Based on the latest available data, the central bank made some 
limited interventions (guided by an algorithm based on market 
movements), and the exchange rate depreciated by about 5 percent 
vis-à-vis US$ since the beginning of the year.  </p>

<h3>Malawi</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The first three cases of COVID-19 were 
confirmed on April 2nd, 2020. A moderate increase in cases followed 
through end-May, when the number of cases accelerated. Active cases 
spiked in early-July and are expected to rise further as local COVID-19 
testing capabilities continue to be expanded with assistance from 
development partners (DFID, UNICEF, and the Global Fund).</p>
<p>To curb the spread of the pandemic, on April 4, the government 
instituted a partial lockdown of the country, with essential services 
continuing to function and critical businesses working in shifts. All 
international flights to Malawi have been suspended except those 
carrying essential health &amp; other supplies and returning Malawian 
citizens or residents. A two-week mandatory self-quarantine for people 
arriving from areas highly affected by coronavirus disease is in effect.
 These measures combined with spillovers from the global slowdown, 
border closures, and economic disruption in neighboring countries have 
slowed domestic economic activity. As a result, growth for 2020 is 
expected to decline to 1 percent. </p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government’s response plan includes US$20 million (0.25 
percent of GDP) in spending on health care and targeted social 
assistance programs; this includes hiring 2000 additional health care 
workers. In addition, tax waivers are being granted on imports of 
essential goods to manage and contain the pandemic. An Emergency Cash 
Transfer Program of about $50 million (0.6 percent of GDP), mostly 
financed by development partners, is being implemented during 
May-November 2020 to support small businesses in major urban areas. </p>

    <p>The domestic currency Liquidity Reserve Requirement (LRR) has 
been reduced by 125 basis points to 3.75 percent (aligned with the 
foreign currency LRR) and the Lombard Rate has been reduced by 50 
percent to 0.2 percentage points above the policy rate. An Emergency 
Liquidity Assistance (ELA) framework has been introduced to support 
banks in the event of worsening liquidity conditions and to provide 
support to banks on a case-by-case basis. However, financial sector 
buffers, including banks’ capital and liquidity buffers, are expected to
 counter risks to the banking system. To support small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs), commercial banks and micro-finance institutions will
 be, on a case-by-case basis, restructuring SME loans and providing a 
moratorium on their debt service until end-2020. Fees on mobile money 
transactions have been temporarily waived to encourage cashless 
transactions.</p>

<h3>Malaysia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Malaysia is being hit by two shocks—the 
spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in oil prices. The first 
COVID-19 confirmed cases was reported on January 25, 2020. A strict 
Movement Control Order (MCO), introduced on March 18, has been effective
 until May 4.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening the economy.</strong> The authorities started 
easing restrictions by allowing most businesses to reopen under a 
Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) from May 4. A Recovery 
Movement Control Order (RMCO) took effect on June 10, lifting most 
restrictions on domestic activities and movement, and its end date has 
been extended from August 31 to December 31 2020. Schools started to 
gradually reopen from June 24, and all students have returned by July 
22. Borders remain closed and overseas travel restricted until at least 
December 31. </p>

<h3>Maldives</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Maldives is being hit hard by the 
outbreak. Maldives’ economy is very dependent on tourism, with tourism 
receipts representing about 60 percent of GDP. The government declared a
 Public Health Emergency on March 12, 2020, and it was extended, by a 
seventh time on July 14, to October 6. Local community transmission was 
detected in Mid-April. The greater Malé region was placed on full 
lockdown during April 15-May 28, with all people going outside their 
homes needing the approval of the Maldives Police Service. Several 
containment measures were adopted during the outbreak, but many of them 
are being gradually lifted.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The country, since July 1,
 2020, is in phase three of the lockdown ease plan.  This phase permits 
movement in the Greater Malé Region from 5am to 11pm, and only 
gatherings of less than 30 people are to be allowed in public spaces. 
International flights as well as tourism island resorts reopened on July
 15, 2020. While guesthouses in inhabited islands are opened since July 
for locals/residents in Covid-19 free islands, most guesthouses remain 
closed for tourists.</p>

    <li>
    <p>To minimize the economic impact of the COVID–19 virus, the authorities <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.finance.gov.mv/media/news/mvr-25-million-economic-recovery-plan" target="_blank">announced</a>
 on March 20 an Economic Recovery Plan of 2.5 Billion rufiyaa (2.8 
percent of GDP). Under the plan, the Government of Maldives will (i) 
reduce recurrent expenditure by 1 billion rufiyaa (1.1 percent of GDP); 
(ii) increase the amount of funds allocated for the health sector; (iii)
 subsidize 40 percent of electricity bills and 30 percent of water bills
 for the months of April and May; (iv) special allowance to those who 
lose their jobs due to Covid-19; and (v) ensure through banks, 
availability of working capital to businesses.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) has been in close contact 
with the banks to discuss the impact on the domestic financial system 
and has identified the measures that can be taken through the financial 
institutions to reduce economic disruptions and loss of jobs and output.
 The&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mma.gov.mv/#/news/PR-MCS-2020-3(english).html">announced</a>measures
 include: (i) reduction of the minimum required reserves (RR) up to 5 
percent as and when required (MVR RR were reduced to 7.5 percent on 
April 23; foreign currency RR were reduced to 5 percent on July 16); 
(ii) making available a short-term credit facility to financial 
institutions as and when required; (iii) introducing regulatory measures
 to enable a moratorium of 6 months on loan repayments for those 
impacted by the current situation (customers have to submit their 
requests to the banks in order to avail themselves of this moratorium).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The MMA has increased its foreign exchange interventions and used
 other available facilities to maintain the exchange rate peg against 
the US dollar. The Reserve Bank of India extended US$150 million foreign
 currency swap support to the MMA on April 28, under the US$ 400 million
 currency swap agreement framework signed between the MMA and the 
Reserve Bank of India in July 2019.</p>

<h3>Mali</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The outbreak reached Mali relatively 
late, with first confirmed cases on March 24. The number of total cases 
continues to rise. The spread of the pandemic slowed with the number of 
new daily registered cases falling from around 45 in mid-June to around 7
 in mid-August (calculated as a 7-day moving average due to high 
variability of the daily data). By early September the number of new 
cases increased to 15 suggesting a slight acceleration of the pandemic. </p>
<p><strong>Initial Containment Measures.</strong> Since mid-March, the 
government has been responding to the global emergence of the pandemic 
with preventive containment measures. These include the suspension of 
commercial flights (except cargo flights), the closure of land borders, a
 curfew from 9:00pm to 5:00am, the suspension of all public gatherings, 
the prohibition of social, sports, cultural and political gatherings of 
more than 50 people. In addition, the government has set up a crisis 
response unit, a hotline for signaling any suspicious case, and is 
stepping up sensitization campaigns, strengthening testing capacities, 
expanding quarantine and hospitalization facilities, and improving 
medical care capacities. Working hours in the public administration have
 been reorganized to end earlier (at 2:30pm), to protect civil servants.
 Retail markets will remain open from 6:00am to 4:00pm, to prevent 
disruptions in the supply of population with basics goods. 10 million 
masks have been distributed to the population. On May 20<sup>th</sup> 400 prisoners were released as a preventive step against the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy</strong>. As of May 9th the measures
 have stared to be relaxed with lifting the night curfew and it has 
become mandatory to wear masks in public. Schools reopened on June 2nd 
for final year students only who are preparing for exams. The schools 
for other students reopened on September 1st. On July 24, the Prime 
Minister signed a decree putting an end to the pandemic-related 
containment restrictions. Air and land border reopened on July 25 and 
July 31, respectively. Normal working hours resumed in public 
administration starting from August 1st.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government has updated its medical response plan to prevent 
the spread of COVID-19 and strengthen its medical care capacity, in 
collaboration with the World Health Organization, now costed at about 
0.6 percent of GDP (including bonuses to health workers). The government
 is also working with the World Bank to enhance its medical care 
capacity, notably in terms of medical equipment (respirators, quarantine
 facilities, etc.). The government’s package of social measures to 
support the most vulnerable households included the setup of a special 
fund to provide targeted income support and a mass distribution of grain
 and food for livestock to the poorest households, the supply of 
electricity and water free of charge to the consumers in the social 
tranche for the months of April and May 2020, a 3-month exemption from 
VAT on electricity and water tariffs, and a 3-month exemption from 
customs duties on the import of basic food (rice and milk). A package of
 economic measures was also launched to ease liquidity constraints on 
ailing firms, including an SME-support guarantee fund, clearing the 
budget spending float, granting tax deferral and relief to ease 
liquidity constraints on the hardest-hit companies, especially in the 
hospitality sector (hotels, restaurants, transportation). On April 27, 
Heads of States of the West-Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) 
declared a temporary suspension of the WAEMU growth and stability Pact 
setting six convergence criteria, including the 3 percent of GDP fiscal 
deficit rule. This temporary suspension will allow member-countries to 
raise their overall fiscal deficit temporarily and use the additional 
external support provided by donors in response to the Covid-19 crisis. 
The Heads of States’ Declaration sets a clear expectation that fiscal 
consolidation will resume once the crisis is over.</p>

</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic 
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks’ 
demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on
 economic activity. The BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a 
fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby 
allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25
 basis points lower than before the crisis. On June 22, the Monetary 
Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the
 monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO 
had also announced: (i) an extension of the collateral framework to 
access central bank refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 
1,700 private companies; (ii) a framework inviting banks and 
microfinance institutions to accommodate demands from customers with 
Covid19-related repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month 
renewable period debt service falling due, without the need to classify 
such postponed claims as non performing; and (iii) measures to promote 
the use of electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April
 2020 a special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 
percent for limited amounts of 3-month "Covid-19 T-Bills" to be issued 
by each WAEMU sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to 
the current pandemic. The amount of such special T-bills issued by Mali 
amounted to CFAF 88 bln (0.9 percent of GDP). Mali has been recently 
allowed to issue the equivalent of 0.5 percent of GDP of new 3-months 
Covid-19 T-Bills that banks may refinance with the BCEAO for their term 
to maturity at 2 percent. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by 
one year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to 
Basel II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory
 capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 
level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 
2023 instead of 2022 initially planned.</p>

<h3>Malta</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The government responded swiftly to 
mobilize the healthcare system and implement containment measures, 
including travel restrictions, social distancing, closures of schools, 
childcare centers, bars, restaurants, sport centers, non-essential shops
 and services, as well as the cancellation of all mass gatherings.  
Malta reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 7, 2020. 
The number of active and new cases has decreased from the first peak in 
April, but has started to rise again from end-July.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Containment measures were 
gradually lifted with the reopening of certain non-essential shops 
started on May 4. More activities and businesses have been allowed to 
open since May 22, including restaurants, hair salons, hotels, funerals,
 individual sports, outdoor pools and gatherings of up to 6 people. Most
 remaining measures have been lifted on June 5. On June 30, the 
government lifted the public health emergency and repealed the remaining
 restrictions including the closures of schools and the ban on mass 
gatherings. People are advised to maintain social distancing and wear 
face masks. Malta’s ports and airport reopened for international 
passenger travel to and from safe countries on July 1.</p>
<p>Following the recent increase in infections, containment measures 
were reintroduced on August 7 and 18, including a ban on mass 
gatherings, a closure of bars and nightclubs, limits on hospital and 
elderly visits, and a requirement to wear face masks in all public 
closed spaces. A contact tracing mobile application was launched on 
September 18. </p>

<h3>Republic of Marshall Islands</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> As of September 25, no COVID-19 case had
 been confirmed in the Marshall Islands. The government responded with 
swift precautionary measures early on. Travel restrictions from affected
 countries have been imposed since January 24. President David Kabua 
declared a State of Health Emergency for COVID19 on February 7th, 2020. A
 ban to incoming travelers established on March 8 was extended through 
October 5, 2020, with the possibility of extensions towards the end of 
the year. On August 26, the Cabinet approved the temporary suspension of
 non-essential departures of RMI citizens, on the back of surging number
 of COVID-19 cases in Hawai and Guam. All air travel between Kwajalein 
and Majuro on international airlines is suspended. All cruise ships and 
liveaboard vessels and yachts are suspended from visiting. All fishing 
vessels that have transited through Covid-19 infected countries are 
suspended from entering RMI ports. To ensure continuity of transshipment
 services, a limited number of carrier vessels coming from 
Covid19-infected countries will be allowed to enter, with strict safety 
requirements including prohibition of human contacts and a minimum of 14
 days between departure from ten restricted countries and arrival in 
RMI. Fisheries, port-related activities, and the hotel and tourism 
sectors are experiencing significant losses.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> To ensure continuity of 
transshipment services, a limited number of carrier vessels and purse 
seiners can enter RMI for transshipment, after spending 14 days at sea 
and only after clearance by corresponding agencies. Container vessels 
and fuel tankers that have a history of entering Majuro and Ebeye ports 
with same crew and corresponding health records can enter ports (no 
disembarkation) without 14-day quarantine. Special exceptions to the ban
 on incoming travelers have been issued for a few returning Marshallese 
and essential personnel for the US Army Garrison in Kwajalein Atoll.  
The mandatory quarantine on anyone coming into the country has been 
extended to 21 days. </p>

    <p>The Government has approved an initial budget of $42 million 
dollars (around 20 percent of GDP) for the national preparedness plan in
 response to the global health pandemic on COVID19. Much of funding will
 cover urgent needs for RMI’s Ministry of Health and Human Services 
(including infrastructure, medical supplies and equipment, and surge 
support) and support to the Neighboring Islands COVID19 preparedness 
plans. The authorities have identified grant support to cover these 
expenditures. The authorities recently announced additional $17 million 
for the COVID-19 response, targeting infrastructure in the outer 
islands, but the details remain unclear.</p>
    <p>To date, the RMI has spent around $ 9.5 million for medical 
equipment and supplies, personal protection equipment, surge capacity 
and major infrastructure projects such as the new isolation and 
quarantine buildings in both Majuro and Ebeye.</p>
    <p>Other major activities include building of hand-washing stations,
 RMI foreign missions assisting the Marshallese citizens living abroad 
and are impacted from COVID19, the economic relief payouts to local 
companies whom are currently affected by COVID19 impacts (The Cabinet

<h3>Mauritania</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Mauritania has reported5,564 (149deaths 
and 2830 recoveries) as of July 15, 2020. The government has taken 
stringent containment measures to limit the spread of the virus, 
including suspension of all commercial flights into and from the 
country; closure of all land borders except for the transportation of 
goods; closure of schools and universities, as well as of all non- 
essential businesses, including restaurants and cafés; suspension of 
non-essential interregional movements of people; a curfew from 9 pm to 
6am throughout the country; and suspension of the Friday prayer. The 
authorities stepped up imports of medical equipment and medicines.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On May 7, 2020 the 
government took the following measures to relax the containment and 
reopen the economy: (i) the opening of most of the businesses, but 
restaurants will only operate for carry-out meals; (ii) the relaxation 
of the curfew that will now take place from 11pm to 6am, instead of from
 9pm to 6am; (iii) the authorization for collective prayer on Friday, 
but with clear guidelines on social distancing, masks wearing, and hands
 washing. However, following the spike in new infections, the Friday 
collective prayer was suspended again from May 14, 2020 to June 24, 
2020. Effective from July 10, 2020 all the remaining restrictions were 
removed, except for the closure of borders and suspension of the 
international commercial flights. The curfew was completely lifted

and financial support to small individual businesses. It also waived 
customs duties and taxes on imports of essential goods and signaled that
 it will take additional measures as more resources are mobilized. On 
May 6, 2020 the government approved additional health, medical supplies,
 social protection, SME support, foodstuff stocks, and security-related 
expenditures to address the pandemic (about $210 million (about 3.2 
percent of GDP). To help provide much-needed resources for health 
services and social protection programs, the IMF Board on April 23, 2020
 granted to Mauritania an emergency financing of SDR 95.68 million

<h3>Mauritius</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Mauritius reported its first cases on 
March 18, 2020. The authorities have implemented a range of containment 
measures since the outbreak, including bans on public gatherings, 
followed by a curfew order, closing borders, discontinuing public 
transportation, closing schools, universities, shopping malls and 
attraction sites, suspending employee attendance at government and 
private workplaces (except for essential staff), and increasing testing.
 On March 25, the authorities further tightened the lockdown by closing 
all supermarkets, bakeries and shops and the next day the government 
began direct food distribution to needy households. On April 2, the 
stores were reopened with increased safety measures. On April 10, the 
government extended the nationwide curfew to May 4, which was further 
extended to June 1. The economy has been severely affected by the 
crisis, with tourism coming to a halt and slowing of activity in other 
sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>On April 27, mass testing 
for antigens was initiated. With no new cases being recorded for almost 3
 weeks and no active cases since May 11, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.govmu.org/English/News/Pages/Government-is-planning-for-a-strategic-phased-resumption-of-economic-activities,-says-PM.aspx" target="_blank">a strategic phased resumption of economic activities began on May 15</a>.
 In the first stage, to return to office the employees needed to obtain a
 Work Access Permit issued by the authorities, except for those working 
in essential sectors. Arrangements have been made by the public 
transport companies to comply with the prescribed health measures and to
 keep physical distance between passengers. Schoolchildren had to stay 
at home, while the courses continued to be delivered remotely. Banks and
 supermarkets still operated on an alphabetical order, and the same 
applied to post offices. On May 15, two Bills were passed in the 
parliament – Covid-19 Bill and Quarantine Bill – which specify the 
details of the transition process from the curfew by strengthening the 
surveillance control and health system preparedness. This allowed the 
progressive reopening of economic and other activities with strict 
sanitary rules and added measures to avoid a resurgence of the disease. 
The nationwide curfew ended on May 30. Physical distancing guidelines 
remained in place, as well as the requirement to wear masks in public. 
While work access permits are no longer required and offices need to 
incorporate social distancing requirements, working from home is 
encouraged. From June 15, most of the activities resumed, with masks and
 physical distancing requirements in effect. The schools will reopen on 
August 1, while the borders remain closed at least until end of August. 
On Aug 31, it was announced that the borders will be reopened in three 
phases: the ongoing first phase focusing on repatriation of Mauritians 
from abroad; the second phase from October 1 with travel to and from 
certain destinations; and the third stage involving full border 
reopening with date to be determined in light of the evolution of the 
pandemic.</p>

    <p>The authorities have announced plans to increase general public 
health spending by Rs1.3 billion (0.28 percent of GDP). A range of 
fiscal support measures have been taken to limit the socio-economic 
impact of COVID-19.  These include the implementation of a Wage 
Assistance Scheme to provide financial support to employees who became 
technically unemployed during the lockdown/curfew period, as well as a 
Self-Employed Assistance Scheme for those employed in the informal 
sector or self-employed.  Some Rs 25 billion were used until September 
and will continue until June 2021. On July 17, it has been announced 
that both schemes will be extended for the month of July, however they 
will only cover employees in the tourism sector. An amount between Rs500
 mill and Rs600 million was expected to be disbursement throughout the 
month, and it was announced that the support to the sector will continue
 to be paid until the borders open. The State Investment Corporation is 
raising some Rs4 billion (0.8 percent of GDP) to make equity investments
 in troubled firms, including SMEs. The Development Bank of Mauritius 
Ltd will provide Rs200 million (0.04 percent of GDP) in credit for firms
 short on cash. All labor contracts set to expire this year have been 
extended through December 2021. The government has also established 
CoVid-19 Solidarity Fund aimed at funding COVID-19 related projects 
(financial support to Mauritian residents and the financing of projects 
related to the COVID-19 virus and other related health issues), with 
around Rs159 million raised by the public and enterprises as of May 26,

1.85 percent on April 16. On March 13, the BOM also adopted a set of 
measures focused on economic operators which are being directly impacted
 by COVID-19, including: i) reduction of the cash reserve ratio from 9 
to 8 percent, with the amount released through the cut earmarked to be 
made available to affected economic operators; ii) special credit line 
of Rs5 billion (1.1 percent or GDP) through commercial banks for 
affected firms to meet their cash flow and working capital requirements,
 with Rs2 billion granted by May 29; iii) commercial banks also provide a
 moratorium of six months on capital repayment for existing loans of 
affected economic operators; iv) the BOM also eased supervisory 
guidelines on handling credit impairments; and v) Rs5 billion (1.1 
percent of GDP) of 2.5 percent two-year BOM savings bonds which will be 
made available to retail investors. On September 7, BOM  announced the 
extension to 31 December 2020 of the moratoriums granted to economic 
operators (including Small and Medium Enterprises), households and 
individuals under its COVID-19 Support Program. The terms and conditions
 of the moratoriums remain unchanged.</p>
    <p>On March 23, BOM announced additional support measures: i)

<h3>Mexico</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVId-19 case was reported on February 28, 2020.</p>
<p>To delay the spread of the coronavirus, the Government declared a 
health emergency and implemented a range of sanitary measures, including
 travel restrictions, social distancing, school closures, and the 
shutdown of non-essential activities. On April 5<sup>th</sup>, President
 López Obrador outlined his Government’s policy priorities to combat the
 economic effects provoked by the spread of the disease, including 
increased health expenditure.</p>
<p>Mexico’s highly open economy has been affected by a reduction in 
export demand on top of the impact of lockdown measures. It was also hit
 by the decline in oil prices and global market volatility. The local 
government bond market has seen cumulative non-resident outflows of 
around US$16 billion (1.5 percent of 2020 GDP), the 10-year dollar 
credit spread widened from 132 bps to 423 bps at peak on April 28th but 
has since declined to 264 bps for the sovereign and from 377 bps to 667 
bps for Pemex after peaking at 1188 bps, while the peso has depreciated 
by 11 percent relative to the US$ (as of September 10th 2020; compared 
to February 20th, 2020), down from a peak of 26 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy</strong>: On May 14, the government 
announced plans to begin the normalization of economic activities, 
including a green-yellow-orange-red color system for states to represent
 the extent of activities allowed (e.g. states with most active cases 
are red and would remain in a forced quarantine), the resumption of 
school and labor activities in municipalities free of infection, and the
 addition of construction, mining, and transport equipment manufacturing
 as essential activities. For the weeks of August 31- September 13, one 
state is in the ‘red’ category with maximal restrictions, while 21 are 
in the orange category, and 10 are in the yellow category. </p>

<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Government is implementing a set of measures aimed to: 1) 
ensure that the Ministry of Health has sufficient financial resources 
and does not face red-tape in procuring medical equipment and materials;
 2) support households and firms; 3) boost credit, strengthen liquidity 
and guarantee the proper functioning of financial markets; 4) accelerate
 the tender processes for public expenditure to ensure full budget 
execution.</p>
    <p>In his speech to the nation on April 5th, President López Obrador
 outlined the Government’s priorities to combat the economic effects of 
COVID-19. Besides higher health expenditure, the plan includes the 
following measures: 1) frontloading two bimesters payments of the 
old-age and disability pensions; 2) accelerating procurement processes 
and VAT refunds; 3) lending to firms and workers in both formal and 
informal sectors; 4) providing liquidity support by development banks 
(64.5 billion pesos). Specifically:</p>
    <p>The Ministry of Economy is granting loans with optional 
repayments to 1 million SMEs that maintain employees on payroll, 
self-employed and domestic workers (25 thousand pesos per loan), and 
another 1 million loans to family businesses previously registered in 
the Welfare Census (25 thousand pesos per loan). The government is

    <p>The Government is implementing other measures, including housing <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gob.mx/issste/prensa/redisena-el-issste-programa-de-prestamos-personales-2020-para-ayudar-a-reactivar-la-economia-en-el-pais?idiom=es" target="_blank">credits for government workers</a>
 with low-interest rates (ISSSTE’ loans for a total amount of 35 billion
 pesos), personal loans at a low rate (3 billion pesos) and a deferral 
program of monthly payments (0.5 billion pesos) by the National Fund 
Institute for Workers’ Consumption (FONACOT).</p>
    <p>Overall, the above-the-line fiscal measures amount to 0.2 percent
 of GDP in health spending and 0.5 percent of GDP to support households 
and firms. Below-the-line measures amount to around 0.5 percent of GDP 
comprising loans to formal workers and recently laid-off workers as well
 as contingent liabilities.</p>
    <p>During the week of April 19th, the President further announced an
 austerity program for public expenditures, including reallocation of 
non-priority expenditure to priority items and voluntary wage reductions
 for high-ranked government officials. </p>

<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The central bank has cut rates by 250 basis points since the 
pandemic outbreak, from March through August 2020. It has also 
introduced measures to support the functioning of the financial system 
amounting to up to 750 billion pesos, or 3.3 percent of 2019 GDP as 
described below.</p>
    <p>To support the flow of credit, the central bank has reduced the 
mandatory regulatory deposit (by 50 billion pesos, or about 15 percent 
of the current stock). It is also opening financing facilities for 
commercial and development banks (350 billion pesos) that would allow 
them to channel resources to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises 
and individuals affected by lockdown measures after the COVID-19 
pandemic. Credit will be provided in exchange for conventional repo 
collateral as well as banks’ corporate loans, which would free up 
liquidity in the banks’ balance sheets.</p>
    <p>To support liquidity in financial markets, the central bank has 
substantially expanded its liquidity facilities, making them more 
affordable, accepting a broader range of collateral, and expanding the 
range of eligible institutions. In particular, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.banxico.org.mx/publications-and-press/other-announcements/%7B6F7FECBA-44CB-6AA5-4E4B-269DDBD9B5A8%7D.pdf" target="_blank">the
 Central Bank opened a facility to repurchase government securities at 
longer maturities than those of regular open market operations</a> for 
up to 100 billion pesos. The cost of the repos were reduced 
significantly.  A debt securities temporary swap facility has been 
introduced to promote orderly debt markets and provide liquidity for 
trading instruments. The central bank also established a corporate 
securities repo facility to support the corporate bond market.</p>
    <p>To ensure the full functioning of financial markets, the central bank <a target="_blank" href="https://www.banxico.org.mx/publicaciones-y-prensa/miscelaneos/%7BCAC09E9F-41AF-48D7-D271-E8FD05BA30B7%7D.pdf">has drawn on the US$60 billion swap line with the Fed</a>.

 and completed two roll-over auctions with declining demand. Increased 
liquidity is being provided during trading hours to avoid spikes in 
short-term interest rates and sterilized at the close of trading. The 
Central Bank is also engaging in government bond swaps to shorten 
government bonds’ maturities in the hands of private institutions, 
thereby improving their liquidity position.</p>
    <p>On the financial side, the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) has <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gob.mx/cnbv/prensa/26-2020-ajustes-y-aclaraciones-a-los-criterios-contables-especiales-emitidos-a-las-instituciones-de-credito?idiom=es" target="_blank">issued temporary exceptional accounting standards</a> allowing <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/543425/Comunicado_029__1_.pdf" target="_blank">credit providers to defer loans for up to 4 or 6 months</a>, and taken measures  related to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/558905/Comunicado_de_Prensa_045_Flexibilizaciones_Onboarding_Remoto_Bancos.pdf" target="_blank">digital onboarding of legal persons</a>
 for the opening of banking accounts and the granting of loans. The 
CNBV, together with the National Insurance and Surety Commission (CNSF),
 also recommended banking and insurance institutions <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/544432/Comunicado_de_Prensa_017_Pago_Dividendos_ok.pdf" target="_blank">not to pay dividends, carry out share buy-backs or conduct any other mechanism aimed at remunerating shareholders</a>.
 It has prohibited naked short-selling, while the circuit breakers in 
the Mexican Stock Exchanges are working well to smooth volatility. 
Furthermore, the Committee on Liquidity Banking Regulation is outlining 
temporary flexibilities on liquidity requirements for banks, permitting 
the use of up to 50% of the capital buffer  and announcing <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gob.mx/cnbv/articulos/criterios-contables-especiales?idiom=es" target="_blank">temporary flexibilities</a>, including those applicable to listed companies, general financial warehouses, and Financial Support Entities.</p>

 were conducted, offering $2 billion each (allocated $2 billion total,

<p><strong>Background. </strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 7, 2020. Confirmed cases have risen progressively, 
prompting a declaration of a <a target="_blank" href="https://gov.md/ro">state of national emergency, restrictions on border crossings, and limits on economic and social activity</a>.
 Among other provisions, the state of emergency allowed Moldovan 
authorities to impose additional border controls, limit movement, 
prohibit large gatherings, manage food supplies, and coordinate media 
messaging about the pandemic. A National Public Health Emergency is in 
place from May 16, following on from the expiration of the National 
State of Emergency on May 15.</p>

    <p>A comprehensive fiscal package has been adopted as per two 2020 
State Budget Amendment, following several targeted fiscal measures to 
support businesses and vulnerable households, such as expanding 
unemployment benefits and strengthening existing targeted social 
assistance, tax relief for sectors affected by state-imposed 
restrictions, delaying tax payment deadlines to mid-2020, suspending tax
 audits and other controls, and increasing state budget allocations to 
the budget emergency and health funds and to a mortgage guarantee 
program.</p>

<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The National Bank of Moldova decreased the base rate applied to 
the main short-term monetary policy operations by 2.25 percentage points
 to 3.25 percent, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bnm.md/en/content/nbm-adjusted-monetary-policy-instruments" target="_blank">decreased</a>
 the required reserve ratio in local currency by 6.5 percentage points 
to the level of 34.0 percent, while the required reserves ratio in 
freely convertible currencies increased by 1.0 percentage point to the 
level of 21.0 percent. These measures were taken with a view to support 
the economy, ease liquidity conditions, and enhance financial system 
resilience. Financial sector policy has thus far focused on providing 
credit institutions with flexibility to manage near-term payment 
obligations of individuals facing financial difficulties without 
recourse to adjustment of prudential provisions, including in cases of

    <p>MNT17 billion (0.04 percent of GDP) of additional health spending
 has been approved and allocated to epidemic prevention and control, 
acquisition of medical supply and medical staff overtime salaries. This 
measure is financed by a Government Reserve Fund withdrawal.</p>
    <p>On March 27, a comprehensive set of fiscal measures for 
consideration was proposed by the cabinet to protect vulnerable 
household and businesses and to support the economy. These include: (i) 
tax exemptions on several imported food and medical items; (ii) increase
 of child allowance and unemployment benefits; (iii) exemptions on CIT, 
PIT, and social security contributions until the end of September; and 
(iv) an increase in credit guarantees to SMEs and soft loans from the 
development bank to cashmere producers. On April 13, Parliament approved
 tax exemption measures as proposed by the cabinet.</p>
    <p>On May 6, a second package of fiscal measures (amounting to 
roughly 2 percent of GDP) was announced to protect the vulnerable 
groups. These include: (i) a further increase in child money allowance; 
(ii) a scale-up of food stamp allowance; and (iii) an increase in social
 welfare pensions for the elderly, disabled, dwarfs, orphans, and single
 parents with more than 4 children. The government has indicated they 
expect to fully offset these measures with expenditure cuts.</p>
    <p>On August 5, the government announced the extension or 
modification of COVID-19 fiscal measures. Extending measures through the
 end of the year include: (i) child money allowance; (ii) CIT exemption;
 (iii) exemption of rent income tax; and (iv) exemption of customs duty 
and VAT on certain imported goods. Modification of measures includes: 
(i) increased food stamp allowance; (ii) increased social welfare 
pensions; and (iii) reduced social security contribution. A 
supplementary budget to contain these measures (amounting to about 7½ 
percent of GDP in total including the previous measures) was approved by
 Parliament on August 28.</p>

of banks by 200 basis points to 8.5 percent; and (iii) narrowed the 
policy rate corridor to ±1 percent. The lower reserve requirement 
released MNT 324 billion (0.8 percent of GDP) of additional liquidity in
 the banking system. On March 18, the BOM and the Financial Regulatory 
Commission implemented temporary financial forbearance measures on 
prudential requirements, loan classifications, and restructuring 
standards. On April 13, the BOM: (i) cut the policy rate by 100 bps to 9
 percent and (ii) allowed existing consumption loan borrowers to defer 
their principal and interest payments by up to 12 months.

<p><strong>Reopening of the economy:</strong> A phased reopening of the 
economy began on May 4, and borders were reopened to countries with 
infections of less than 25 per 100,000 inhabitants on June 1. A decision
 was taken on June 30 to open borders to residents of all EU member 
states without additional conditions. The “green list” was further 
updated on August 3 to include Russia and Azerbaijan.  From Aug 15, the 
land borders with Serbia, Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina 
were reopened.  Residents from these countries as well as the USA are 
permitted to enter Montenegro with a negative PCR test not older than 72
 hours. Montenegrin residents who have traveled to regional countries 
are also required to undertake health supervision measures upon their

    <p>On July 30, the Central Bank announced that banks are obliged to 
grant a moratorium to borrowers from two priority sectors: tourism, as 
well as agriculture, forestry, and fishing. The moratorium can be used 
in the period of September 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021, and is available 
to borrowers in these sectors who are not past due in loan repayments 
for more than 90 days and whose loans were not classified as 
non-performing assets as of December 31, 2019. Banks are also allowed to
 treat approved or restructured loans in these sectors as loans from 
category “A” during the duration specified above.</p>
    <p>This follows the announcement of May 20 that banks can approve a 
new moratorium for borrowers facing difficulties due to the 
pandemic.&nbsp; Banks may also, under clearly specified conditions, 
approve the restructuring of loans, including unsecured cash loans. A 
previously announced moratorium on loan repayments for a period of up to
 90 days (announced on March 17) was available to all borrowers.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The central bank has also announced measures to temporarily 
prohibit banks from paying dividends to shareholders, except in the form
 of equity, and to allow banks to increase exposures to a person or 
group of related parties beyond the prescribed exposure limits (25 
percent of the bank’s own funds), with prior central bank approval.</p>
    <p>Other measures include the decision to halve the fee that banks 
are required to pay for withdrawing reserve requirement liquidity 
(announced on May 7) and the reduction of the reserve requirement rate 
by 2 percentage points (announced May 12).</p>
    <p>The Deposit Protection Fund has also increased its credit line with the EBRD to EUR 50 million (from EUR 30 million).</p>

<h3>Morocco</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Morocco reported its first confirmed 
cases of COVID-19 on March 2, 2020. The government created an emergency 
committee chaired by the Minister of Finance in charge of monitoring the
 situation. The authorities declared a state of health emergency until 
August 10 initially, adopted containment measures, including quarantine,
 suspended all international passenger flights, forbid all public 
gatherings, and closed mosques, schools, universities, restaurants, 
cafes, and hammams. The authorities also decided to regulate prices and 
control the distribution channels of facemasks and hydro alcoholic gels.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>The authorities announced 
partial reopening measures starting June 11, 2020. Most businesses are 
authorized to resume, including dine-in at café and restaurants, 
theaters and hammams. The authorities eased restrictions in most rural 
areas and small towns, resuming operations of public transport and 
removing restrictions to movement and travel, including for domestic 
flights. International borders were reopened on July 14 for Moroccan 
nationals leaving abroad and foreigners established in Morocco. However,
 the increase in the number of cases in late July required to tighten 
restrictions in a number of urban areas that remain under a partial 
lockdown and now experience new restrictions to movements. Large 
gatherings continue to be banned and wedding parties are not allowed in 
Morocco. The government also extended the state of health emergency 
until October 10.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The authorities have created a special fund dedicated to the 
management of the pandemic, of about 3 percent of GDP financed by the 
government and by voluntary contributions from public and private 
entities which will be tax deductible. This fund covers the costs of 
upgrading medical facilities and support businesses and households 
impacted by the pandemic. Businesses with less than 500 employees made 
temporarily idle and experiencing a reduction in turnover of more than 
50 percent were authorized to defer social contribution payments until 
June 30. Their employees who become temporarily unemployed and are 
registered with the pension fund received 2,000 dirhams a month and were
 allowed put off debt payments until June 30. In April, almost 1 million
 workers from 134,000 companies were eligible to these transfers. 
Companies and households can also defer income tax payment until 
September 30, 2020. In addition, the government has decided to 
accelerate payment to its suppliers to support businesses. On September 
9, the government has extended social transfers to employees temporarily
 unemployed and further deferred social contribution payments for some 
sectors (including tourism).</p>
    <p>The government also took measures to support households working 
in the informal sector. Households’ benefiting from the non-contributory
 health insurance (RAMED)  received a monthly mobile payment of DRH 
800-1200 (USD 80-120) from April, depending on households’ composition. 
Other households which do not benefit from RAMED can claim cash support 
by registering online. In April, 85 percent of eligible households in 
the informal sectoral were covered. The government postponed the 
deadline for personal income tax filing from end-April to end-June 2020 
and provided a tax exemption for additional compensation paid by firms 
to employees in the formal sector up to a limit of 50 percent of the 
average monthly net salary. A decree-law adopted on April 6 authorizes 
the government to increase external borrowing beyond the ceiling 
approved in the 2020 Budget Act.</p>
    <p>On August 6, the authorities announced a plan to sustain the 
economic recovery and employment levels. The plan envisages the 
mobilization of DRH 120 billion, mainly in the form of credit guarantees
 to firms and funding for a newly -created “Fund for Strategic 
Investment”, which will finance investment projects (including PPPs) and
 sustain the capital of firms that needs equity injections to develop 
their business. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The central bank reduced the policy rate by 75 bps to 1.5 percent
 since March 2020. To support companies, loan payments are suspended for
 small and medium-sized businesses and self-employed people until June 
30. To reduce volatility, the Capital Market Authority decided to revise
 downwards the maximum variation thresholds applicable to financial 
instruments listed in Casablanca Stock Exchange.</p>
    <p>Given growing demand for liquidity support in the banking system 
(both in DRH and in EUR/USD), Bank al-Maghrib decided on a three-pronged
 approach to increase liquidity provision to the banking sector: (i) 
expand the range of collateral accepted for repos and credit guarantees 
to include public and private debt instruments (including mortgages), 
(ii) increase and lengthen central bank refinancing operations to 
support banking credit to (V)SMEs, and (iii) provide FX swaps to 
domestic banks. In addition, Bank al-Maghrib decided to bring reserve 
requirements to zero (from 2 percent) to increase liquidity provision, 
and to ease refinancing of banks’ contribution to microcredit 
institutions and credit unions.</p>
    <p>On March 29, the central bank decided the following prudential 
and regulatory measures to support the banking sector: (i) Banks are 
authorized to go below the 100 percent liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
until end-June 2019; (ii) Provisioning requirements are suspended for 
loans’ benefiting from a temporary payment moratorium until end-June 
2019; (iii) The capital conservation buffer (CCB) is reduced by 50 bps 
for one year. In addition, the central bank has call on banks to suspend
 dividend payments for FY2019. </p>
    <p>On April 24, the Moroccan insurance supervisor relaxed some 
provisioning requirements to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the 
insurance sector.</p>
    <p>In addition, Morocco has established a funding for lending 
facility (Damane Oxygene) which provides loans to (V)SMEs at subsidized 
interest rates with a guarantee of 95 percent from the Central Guarantee
 Fund. On May 15, this program was extended to end-2020, and collateral 
requirements were removed to improve access for (V)SMEs. 17,500 
companies have benefitted from this facility, for a total outstanding 
amount of 1.6 percent of GDP.</p>
    <p>In addition, the government will provide interest-free loan of up
 to dirham 15,000 to self-employed, with a repayment period of three 
years and a grace period of one year. The government also cancelled 
capitalized interests on mortgages (up to DRH 3000 per month) and 
consumer loans (up to DRH 1500 per month) accrued from March to June 
2020 for all households experiencing income losses.</p>
    <p>On May 21, the government announced a post crisis facility 
(Damane Relance) to support businesses that will provide financing to 
cover working capital needs at subsidized interest rate (with a 4 
percent maximum interest rate, equivalent to the current policy rate + 
200 basis points). A sovereign guarantee of 95 percent will be provided 
to SMEs, for an equivalent of up to ten percent of annual turnover. 
Larger firms will benefit from a sovereign guarantee of 80 to 90 percent
 of the outstanding loan, which will be capped at one month of turnover 
for most sectors. Firms will have 7 years to repay with a 2-year grace 
period. In addition, the government will guarantee state-owned 
enterprises’ loan that will be provided by banks exclusively to repay 
their suppliers. At end-August, banks provided loans worth about 2.1 
percent of GDP to 15,000 firms under this facility.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>As part of a gradual and orderly transition to a more flexible 
exchange rate regime, the authorities broadened the dirham’s fluctuation
 band to +/- 5 percent (from +/- 2.5 percent) on March 6, 2020. </p>
    <p>On April 7, the Moroccan authorities purchased all available 
resources (about US$ 3 billion or 240 percent of quota and about 3 
percent of GDP) under the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) 
arrangement. This purchase will help the authorities limit the social 
and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and allow Morocco to 
maintain an adequate level of official reserves to mitigate pressures on
 the balance of payments.</p>

<h3>Mozambique</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong>. Mozambique reported its first COVID-19 
case on March 22, 2020. Daily new cases have been increasing rapidly 
since early September.</p>
<p>Early on, the government took several actions to contain an outbreak 
of Covid-19 in the country, stating that “prevention remains the best 
strategy.” These actions included (i) the shutdown of schools form 
pre-school up to university, (ii) the ban of all gatherings – including 
religious services - of more than 50 persons, (iii) the ban and 
cancellation of all entry visas, (iv) a 14-day quarantine for all 
travelers entering Mozambique and (v) the creation of a technical and 
scientific committee to advise the government. The government has made 
it mandatory to wear face masks in public places.  </p>
<p>On March 30, President Nyusi declared a state of emergency for the 
month of April, extended three times (until July 30). On August 5, the 
President declared a second state of emergency (after 3 consecutive 
months of State of Emergency allowed by the Constitution) to further 
halt the spread of the Covid-19. The measures to prevent the spread of 
the new coronavirus now include: (i) imposing limitations on movements 
within the country and border entries; (ii) ban on all types of public 
or private events; (iii) closure or reduction of non-essential shops; 
(iv) monitoring prices of essential goods for preventing price gouging; 
(v) redirecting the industrial sector toward the production of goods 
necessary for the prevention and mitigation of the Covid-19 pandemic; 
(vi) introducing employee rotation in the workspace; and (vii) ensuring 
the adoption of preventative actions in all institutions, public or 
private. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy</strong>. The government announced 
the reopening of schools for 12th grade (pre-university) and teacher 
training colleges on July 27th, if hygiene conditions are met. About 25 
percent of secondary schools and 70 percent of teacher training colleges
 currently meet the conditions. The new state of emergency envisages 
gradual easing of restrictions in three phases starting on August 18 
with low risk activities including reopening of universities and other 
senior level colleges and religious gathering with no more than 50 
people.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 10, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government has increased the budget allocation for health, 
from about MT 2 billion (or about 0.2 percent of GDP) to about MT 3.3 
billion (0.3 percent of GDP). In addition, the government has asked 
Mozambique’s development partners for US$ 700 million to help deal with 
the economic impact of the pandemic. This fiscal package would finance 
(i) temporary and well-targeted tax exemptions to support families and 
the health sector (VAT and import tariff exemptions on food, medicine 
and medical equipment), and (ii) higher spending to respond to the 
health crisis and humanitarian needs, including higher health related 
spending on goods and services, and higher cash transfers and subsidies 
to the poorest households as well as micro-businesses and SMEs. In May, 
the government extended the VAT exemption on sugar, vegetable oil and 
soap until the end of the year. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>To ease liquidity conditions, on March 16, the central bank 
reduced reserve requirements by 150 basis points for both foreign 
currency and domestic currency deposits (to 11.5 percent and 34.5 
percent respectively). On March 22, it announced measures to support 
financial markets and encourage prudent loan restructuring by: (i) 
introducing a foreign currency credit line for institutions 
participating in the Interbank Foreign Exchange (FX) Market, in the 
amount of US$ 500 million, for a period of nine months; and (ii) waiving
 the constitution of additional provisions by credit institutions and 
financial companies in cases of renegotiations of the terms and 
conditions of the loans, before their maturity, for clients affected by 
the pandemic, until December 31. On March 30, the central bank announced
 measures to ease payment system transactions and liquidity conditions 
by: (i) lowering fees and charges for digital transactions through 
commercial banks, mobile banking and e-currency, for a period of three 
months, and (ii) waiving specific provision on foreign currency loans, 
until December 31. The central bank reduced the policy rate by 150 bps 
to 11.25 percent on April 16. On April 29, the central bank introduced a
 requirement for exporters to exchange at least 30 percent of FX 
proceeds into domestic currency. On June 17, the central bank reduced 
the policy rate by 100 bps to 10.25 and lifted the twice a week access 
restriction on the standing lending facility introduced in October 2016.</p>

<h3>Myanmar</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 24, 2020. Local transmissions have been rapidly 
increasing in Rakhine State and Yangon Region. Semi lockdown with 
stay-at-home instruction was issued for entire Rakhine State starting 
August 27, and for all townships except the isolated Cocogyun Township 
(located on a far island) in Yangon Region starting September 21. In 
addition, responding to this surge in transmissions, the authorities 
have shut down schools across the country. The economy has been deeply 
affected by the outbreak, with sharp declines in tourist arrivals, 
supply chain disruptions for the garment sector, and losses for SMEs, 
which have resulted in large layoffs and factory closures. In response, 
the government has announced measures to limit the spread of the virus 
including&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tourism.gov.mm/travel-advisory-15/" target="_blank">travel restrictions</a>&nbsp;(including
 quarantine requirements, suspension of visa issuances and international
 flights), closure of several land borders, and bans on mass public 
gatherings. A National Central Committee on Prevention, Control and 
Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus has been&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.moi.gov.mm/moi:eng/?q=news/8/02/2020/id-20762" target="_blank">established</a>&nbsp;to
 coordinate the authorities’ response. A second committee, the Control 
and Emergency Response Committee on COVID-19, was setup on March 30 to 
help with stricter administrative measures to control the spread of the 
virus including quarantining migrant workers coming from neighboring 
countries. The Myanmar government has developed the COVID-19 Economic 
Relief Plan (CERP) consisting of seven goals, 10 strategies, 36 action 
plans and 76 actions that cover a range of emergency fiscal and monetary
 measures. The CERP seeks to mitigate the inevitable economic impact 
posed by COVID-19 while establishing a foundation to facilitate 
Myanmar’s rapid economic recovery. All instructions (excluding some 
relaxations) relating COVID-19 prevention and control have been extended
 to August 31, 2020. Restrictions on visa issuances and international 
passenger flights have also been extended to September 30. </p>

<h3>Namibia</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Namibia reported its first case of 
COVID19 on March 14, 2020. Cases have increased rapidly recently and 
have caused one of the main ports to be temporarily closed (due to a 
lockdown in the region). The total number of cases remains low. The 
government declared a national state of emergency and adopted 
containment measures, including social distancing, work from home 
initiatives (including suspension of the parliament for 21 days), 
lockdowns in some regions, and closures of all points of entry and 
comprehensive restrictions on cross-border travel. The domestic travel 
lockdown was relaxed on May 4th (so people can travel inside the country
 with some constrains on number of vehicle occupants), points of entry 
remain closed, except for the transportation of goods. The authorities 
further eased restrictions on travel by removing the obligation to 
quarantine for tourists with negative PCR test result. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On April 1st the government launched the Economic Stimulus and 
Relief Package to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 (8 billion Namibian 
Dollars, or 4.25 percent of GDP), including i) expenditure measures of 
2.2 bn for health, wage subsidies for affected sectors, and income 
grants; and ii) guarantees of up to 2.3 bn to support low interest loans
 for small and agricultural businesses, and individuals. On June 15th, 
the government announced it will extend the deadline of submitting 
Individual Income Tax returns from June 30 to September 30 (not the 
payment of taxes due, which is still June 30). In August the Bank of 
Namibia announced it will participate in the operationalization of the 
loan guarantee program, providing 50 million Namibian dollars in capital
 targeted to SME credit.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The central bank reduced the policy rate by 25 basis points to 
3.75 percent on August 19, 2020 (250 bps total since the state of 
emergency was declared). On March 26, the central bank announced changes
 in the financial sector and its regulatory setting, including i) 
allowing banks to grant loan payment moratorium (payment holidays) 
ranging from 6 to 24 months, ii) regulatory and policy relief changes, 
such as relaxing the determination on liquidity risk management, 
reducing the capital conservation buffer rate to 0 percent for at least 
24 months to support banking institutions to supply credit, and 
postponing the effective date of implementation of the 25 percent single
 borrower limit and concentration risk limit.</p>

<h3>Nauru</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> As of September 24, 2020, Nauru has no 
confirmed cases of COVID-19.  It remains one of only 12 countries in the
 world with no confirmed cases, as per the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus 
Tracker. The main impact of the pandemic thus far has been due to travel
 restrictions and quarantine. Supply chain dislocations have also had an
 impact as a lower frequency of cargo ships have affected the timely 
supply of construction and consumption goods. That said, incoming data 
on fishing license revenues and recent developments suggest that the 
overall real impact of the pandemic has been relatively mild.</p>
<p>The government has imposed a number of containment measures including
 a near-total ban on entry by air into Nauru which was effective March 
16. Cargo flights are operating at normal frequency at this time, but 
subject to strict handling on arrival, including on contact with crew. 
Screening and quarantine measures have also been in effect since March 
16 and apply to all passengers on arrival, including a mandatory 14-day 
stay in approved transition accommodation and further measures for 
symptomatic cases. On April 9, the Government of Nauru extended the 
emergency measures to be in force until they announce an easing [date 
unspecified]. Social distancing measures have been encouraged including 
limiting or cancelling public gatherings and recommending working 
arrangements from home where possible.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>While mitigation measures have not been needed, containment 
efforts have been sizeable and expenditures on keeping the national 
airline and other SOEs afloat have been significant at about 5.5 percent
 of 2019 GDP. Initial estimates from the health and immigration 
department suggest an estimated AUD 3.5 million for health expenditures 
and isolation costs per 500 individuals (approximately 4 percent of the 
population), AUD  5.1 million on liquidity injections to Nauru Airlines,
 an estimated AUD 0.5 million in budget support to SOEs in managing 
inventory from limited freight and cargo services. The authorities have 
reprioritized expenditures and drawn down on cash buffers and general 
reserves to support the fiscal measures, including necessary medical 
expenditures. Apart from containment and mitigation, the government has 
also used its cash buffers for the repatriation of Nauruans abroad. The 
authorities have implemented a testing regime for COVID-19 and reduced 
the mandated time in quarantine, alleviating some of the budgetary 
implications of containment.  The ADB has approved a US$5 million 
policy-based grant to support public investment management, fiscal 
sustainability in Nauru; and to help the Government of Nauru improve the
 management of public expenditure and national infrastructure, as well 
as the governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).</p>

<h3>Nepal</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Nepal’s first confirmed COVID-19 case 
was on January 23, and the country continues to see a gradual increase 
in the number of confirmed cases. At end-March, the authorities imposed a
 nationwide lockdown, a ban on domestic and international flights, and a
 closure of land border crossings. The government lifted the national 
lockdown on July 22 but has since had to reimpose restrictions because 
of rapidly rising Covid-19 cases. International flights resumed on 
September 2, 2020 and domestic flights and long-haul public transport 
services resumed on September 17. The ongoing ‘relaxed’ prohibitory

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Measures announced March 30. Health spending will be increased, 
including by providing additional insurance coverage to all medical 
personnel fighting the coronavirus, importing additional medical 
supplies (with duty on said items eliminated), and setting up quarantine
 centers and temporary hospitals. Social assistance will be strengthened
 by providing those most vulnerable with daily food rations, subsidizing
 utility bills for low-usage customers, extending tax-filing deadlines, 
and taking measures to partially compensate those in the formal sector 
for lost wages in the event of job loss.</p>
    <p>Measure announced April 26. Informal sector workers who have lost
 their jobs due to the ongoing crisis will be given the opportunity to 
participate in public-works projects for a subsistence wage or receive 
25 percent of local daily wage should they choose not to participate.</p>
    <p>Measures announced May 28. In the budget speech for fiscal year 
2020/21, Finance Minister Khatiwada announced additional measures in the
 areas of healthcare (the establishment of additional hospital 
facilities), business-support (a lending program for cottage, small and 
medium-sized enterprises and those in the tourism sector), and 
job-creation (labor-intensive in the construction sector, and training 
for work in manufacturing and services sectors).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Measures announced March 29. To provide liquidity to the 
financial system, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) lowered its cash reserve 
ratio from 4 to 3 percent and reduced the interest rate on the standing 
liquidity facility rate from 6 to 5 percent. The NRB is no longer 
requiring banks to build up the 2 percent countercyclical capital buffer
 that was due in July 2020. The NRB temporarily relaxed reporting norms 
and announced that bank and financial institutions will not be charged 
or penalized for their non-compliance with regulatory and supervisory 
requirements in April. The size of the Refinance Fund has been increased
 to provide subsidized funding for banks willing to lend at a 
concessional rate to priority sectors including small and mid-size 
enterprises affected by the pandemic. </p>
    <p>Measures announced April 29. The NRB announced that banks will 
defer loan repayments due in April and May until mid-July. For working 
capital loans, banks will extend the repayment schedule of the amount 
due during the lockdown up to 60 days. Businesses in affected sectors, 
if they can show the needs, can qualify for additional working capital 
loans of up to 10 percent of the approved amount of their existing 
working capital loans, to be repaid within a year at most. The NRB 
directed banks to apply lower interest rates (up to 2 percentage points)
 when calculating the interest due for the period of mid-April to 
mid-July, applicable to borrowers from affected sectors.</p>
    <p>Measures announced in July 17. The NRB lowered the policy rate 
from 3.5 percent to 3 percent and announced that additional liquidity 
support will be made available through longer-term repo facility as 
necessary. The limit on the loan to value ratio for personal residential
 home loans was raised to 60 percent and margin natured loans to 70 
percent from 65 percent. The limit on banks’ total loans was raised to 
85 percent of the sum of core credit and deposits from 80 percent. The 
NRB requires banks to increase their loans to priority sectors, such as 
agriculture, energy, tourism, and micro, small and mid-size enterprises,
 to 40 percent from 25 percent by 2024. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On April 1, the authorities imposed a temporary ban on luxury 
goods imports, such as gold over 10 kg and vehicles worth over US$50 
thousand, and will temporarily provide a minimum currency exchange 
facility to qualifying students abroad (less than US$500 per student).</p>

<h3>The Netherlands</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first cases of COVID-19 infections 
were reported in the Netherlands in late February. The authorities have 
taken measures to limit the spread of the virus, including ordering 
closure of schools and many catering businesses, and advising to avoid 
social contact and work from home to the extent possible. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Starting on May 11, the 
Dutch government has laid down a progressive easing of the lockdown 
measures under strict conditions. For example, childcare services, 
primary and secondary schools were allowed to reopen, as well as most 
businesses (including for example hairdressers, restaurants and cafes, 
and cultural institutions). In addition, gatherings of more than 100 
people in a closed space were allowed, no limit imposed on occupancy in 
cinemas, cafés and restaurants, and the travel ban for travelers from 14
 non-EU countries was lifted. Social distancing requirements 
nevertheless remain in place (including maintaining a 1.5 meters 
distance between persons from different households, and wearing face 
masks in public transportation). However, with the recent resurgence in 
the number of infections, the authorities are introducing new measures 
to limit the spread of the virus. These include, as of August 6, 
compulsory testing at Schiphol airport and mandatory temporary closing 
of entertainment businesses experiencing an outbreak. On August 18, the 
government reinstated its recommendation to work from home to the extent
 possible, and to limit the number of guess a household can host to no 
more than six people. Starting on September 20,  additional measures are
 in effect in six regions to further contain the spread of virus. These 
include closure of cafes and restaurant at 1 am and limiting group 
gatherings to 50 people. The authorities in these regions can take 
additional measures if deemed necessary.   </p>

<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>A series of&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">fiscal measures </span>have
 been introduced since the start of the pandemic to contain the economic
 impact of the outbreak. The two first support packages (announced in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2020/03/19/coronavirus-dutch-government-adopts-package-of-new-measures-designed-to-save-jobs-and-the-economy" target="_blank">March</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2020/05/20/coronavirus-verlenging-en-uitbreiding-noodpakket-banen-en-economie" target="_blank">May</a>,
 respectively) include spending measures estimated at about 33 billion 
euros (4.2 percent of GDP) in 2020, and covering&nbsp; (i) compensation 
of up to 90 percent of labor costs for companies expecting a reduction 
in revenues of 20 percent or more; (ii) compensation for affected 
sectors (hospitality, travel, agriculture, culture, and others); (iii) 
support for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2020/04/28/coronavirus-verdere-uitbreiding-en-versoepeling-regelingen-voor-ondernemers" target="_blank">entrepreneurs</a>
 and the self-employed, start-ups and small innovation companies; (iv) 
scaling up of the short-time working scheme (unemployment benefit 
compensation available to companies needing to reduce their staff by at 
least 20 percent), (v) <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2020/05/28/uitbreiding-op-ondernemersregelingen-noodpakket-banen-en-economie" target="_blank">allowances for SMEs to help them finance their fixed costs</a>.
 In addition, companies can defer tax payments without penalties, and 
calculate provisional taxes on the basis of expected reduced activity 
levels. In 2020, revenue shortfalls from deferral of tax payments are 
estimated at 27 billion euros (or 3.5 percent of GDP). Also, public 
guarantee schemes (with a ceiling recently increased to  61 billion 
euros, or 7.8 percent of GDP), especially for SME loans but also 
covering large firms, are expanded to help the most vulnerable companies
 to manage their liquidity problems. A <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2020/04/07/kabinet-helpt-leveranciers-en-ondernemers-met-hun-leverancierskrediet" target="_blank">guarantee scheme for supplier credit</a> has also been established. On August 28, the government announced the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2020/08/28/kabinet-verlengt-coronasteun-banen-en-economie-tot-en-met-2021" target="_blank">third support package</a>
 which primarily aims at expanding measures already in place on the 
expenditure side through June 2021. This new package includes additional
 expenditure of 12.5 billion (or 1.7 percent of GDP), of which 1.5 
billion of public investment. The authorities aim at supporting labor 
mobility toward expanding sectors. Platforms to facilitate job 
transition are being developed, and public financing is being allocated 
for training of employees. The total cost of these programs will depend 
on demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The ECB <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.mp200312~8d3aec3ff2.en.html" target="_blank">decided to provide monetary policy support</a>
 through (i) additional asset purchases of €120 billion until end-2020 
under the existing program (APP), and (ii) providing temporarily 
additional auctions of the full-allotment, fixed rate temporary 
liquidity facility at the deposit facility rate and more favorable terms
 on existing targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) 
starting between June 2020 and June 2021. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html" target="_blank">Further measures</a>
 included an additional €750 billion asset purchase program of private 
and public sector securities (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, PEPP)
 until end-2020, an expanded range of eligible assets under the 
corporate sector purchase program (CSPP), and relaxation of collateral 
standards for Eurosystem refinancing operations (MROs, LTROs, TLTROs).</p>
    <p>The ECB Banking Supervision <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200312~45417d8643.en.html" target="_blank">allowed significant institutions</a>
 to operate temporarily below the Pillar 2 Guidance, the capital 
conservation buffer, and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). In 
addition, new rules on the composition of capital to meet Pillar 2 
Requirement (P2R) were front-loaded to release additional capital. The 
ECB considers that the appropriate release of the countercyclical buffer
 by the national macroprudential authorities will enhance its capital 
relief measures. The ECB Banking Supervision <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ssm.pr200320~4cdbbcf466.en.html" target="_blank">further decided </a>to
 exercise – on a temporary basis – flexibility in the classification 
requirements and expectations on loss provisioning for non-performing 
loans (NPLs) that are covered by public guarantees and COVID-19 related 
public moratoria; it also recommended that banks avoid pro-cyclical 
assumptions for the determination of loss provisions and opt for the 
IFRS9 transitional rules. More recently, ECB Banking Supervision asked 
banks to not pay dividends for the financial years 2019 and 2020 or buy 
back shares during COVID-19 pandemic, from which the conserved capital 
should be used to support households, small businesses and corporate 
borrowers and/or to absorb losses on existing exposures to such 
borrowers.</p>
    <p>In addition, the Dutch central bank has&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dnb.nl/en/news/news-and-archive/persberichten-2020/dnb387870.jsp" target="_blank">reduced systemic buffer requirements</a>&nbsp;for the three largest banks to support bank lending. The central bank is also&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/7/50-238184.jsp" target="_blank">taking measures to provide temporary regulatory relief to less significant banking institutions</a>.
 Banks under direct supervision of DNB are also allowed to exclude 
specific central bank exposures when calculating their leverage ratios. 
Furthermore, the planned introduction of a floor for mortgage loan risk 
weighting is postponed. In turn, the largest Dutch banks have agreed 
to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nvb.nl/english/corona-banks-offer-smes-extra-breathing-space-six-months-postponement-of-repayments/" target="_blank">grant SMEs a six-month postponement of their loan repayments</a>. To protect homeowners, the government and relevant stakeholders agreed that there will be <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2020/04/07/geen-gedwongen-verkopen-van-huizen-gedurende-coronacrisis" target="_blank">no mortgage foreclosures until July 1st</a>.
 From July 1st, homeowners facing financial difficulties are encouraged 
to contact their lender to renegotiate more flexible terms for the 
period covering the ongoing economic crisis.</p>

<h3>New Zealand</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case in New
 Zealand was reported on February 28, 2020. On March 25, 2020, New 
Zealand moved to Alert Level 4 restrictions after domestic transmission 
of the virus was found. The authorities declared a state of emergency 
and implemented strong containment measures, including the closure of 
all non-essential businesses, cancellation of all events and gatherings,
 and closure of schools. This followed the closure of all borders to 
non-residents on March 19, with returning residents required to enter 
into two weeks of supervised quarantine since April 10. After a gradual 
reopening through Alert Levels 3 (April 28) and 2 (May 13), New Zealand 
moved to Alert Level 1 on June 8, lifting restrictions on personal 
movements, gathering, workplaces, and services. The border closure and 
quarantine requirement remain in place. </p>
<p>Following the emergence of new COVID-19 cases, Auckland returned to 
Alert Level 3 restrictions on August 12, and restrictions were 
subsequently eased to Alert Level 2.5 (Alert Level 2 with extra 
gathering restrictions) on August 30 and to Alert Level 2 on September 
24. The rest of the country was placed under Alert Level 2 on August 12 
and returned to Alert Level 1 on September 24. Cabinet will review the 
Alert Level setting again on October 5. </p>
<p>New Zealand’s economy contracted by 9.8 percent q/q in Q2, 2020 
(expenditure side), and high-frequency indicators point to an incipient 
recovery in Q3.</p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>With the FY2020-21 budget and previous fiscal packages, the 
government has announced fiscal measures amounting to a total of NZ$58.5
 billion (19.5 percent of GDP) through FY2023-24. The total amount 
includes the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, of which NZ$14.1 
billion have been set aside as contingency for a possible second wave. 
Announced fiscal measures include: (i) healthcare-related spending to 
reinforce capacity (NZ$0.8 billion or 0.3 percent of GDP); (ii) a 
permanent increase in social spending to protect vulnerable people 
(total NZ$2.4 billion or 0.8 percent of GDP); (iii) a wage subsidy to 
support employers severely affected by the impact of COVID-19 (NZ$14.8 
billion or 4.9 percent of GDP); (iv) income relief payments to support 
people who lost their jobs (NZ$0.6 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP); (v) a
 permanent change in business taxes to help cashflow (NZ$2.8 billion or 
0.9 percent of GDP); (vi) infrastructure investment (NZ$3.8 billion or 
1.3 percent of GDP); (vii) transport projects (NZ$0.6 billion or 0.2 
percent of GDP); (viii) a temporary tax loss carry-back scheme (NZ$3.1 
billion or 1.0 percent of GDP); (ix) support for the aviation sector 
(NZ$0.6 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP); (x) a tourism recovery package 
(NZ$0.4 billion or 0.1 percent of GDP); (xi) a government housing 
program (NZ$0.7 billion or 0.2 percent of GDP); and (xii) school 
infrastructure upgrades (NZ$0.2 billion or 0.1 percent of GDP). The 
government has also approved a NZ$0.9 billion debt funding agreement 
(convertible to equity) with Air New Zealand to ensure continued freight
 operations, domestic flights and limited international flights. The New
 Zealand government also provides loans of up to NZ$100,000 to small 
businesses that employ 50 or less employees (NZ$5.2 billion). In 
addition, on March 28 the government announced temporary removal of 
tariffs on all medical and hygiene imports needed for the COVID-19 
response.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept the official cash 
rate (OCR) at 0.25 percent on September 23, unchanged since the OCR was 
reduced by 75 basis points on March 17. In August, to further ease 
monetary policy, the RBNZ expanded the Large-Scale Asset Purchase 
program (LSAP) to purchase government bonds and Local Government Funding
 Agency (LGFA) in the secondary market from up to NZ$60 billion for 12 
months to a maximum of NZ$100 billion by June 2022. It also announced 
that a package of additional monetary instruments will remain in active 
preparation for a possible need for further monetary stimulus, depending
 on the outlook for inflation and employment. The package of additional 
instruments includes a negative OCR supported by a Funding for Lending 
Program (funding retail banks directly at near-OCR) and purchases of 
foreign assets.</p>
    <p>Since March, the RBNZ has been providing liquidity in the FX swap
 market and re-established a temporary US dollar swap line (US$30 
billion) with the U.S. Federal Reserve. The RBNZ has established a new 
Term Auction Facility (TAF), which allows banks access to collateralized
 loans of up to 12 months, and announced a corporate facility in which 
the RBNZ will offer up to NZ$500 million per week in open market 
operations with banks against corporate paper and asset-backed 
securities for 3 months. The RBNZ has also introduced a Term Lending 
Facility (TLF), a longer-term funding scheme for banks at 0.25 percent 
for up to 3 years duration initially for six months from May 26. From 
August 26, the lending term of the TLF has been extended to 5 years and 
the facility has been extended to Feb 1, 2021. Access to the TLF is 
linked to each banks’ lending under a NZ$6.25 billion Business Finance 
Guarantee Scheme (BFGS) in which the government covers 80 percent of the
 credit risk and will require approved eligible collateral. The BFGS was
 expanded in August, increasing the maximum loan amount from NZ$0.5 
million to NZ$5 million, lengthening the maximum term from three to five
 years, and allowing more loan access by medium-sized firms. The RBNZ 
has reduced the banks’ core funding ratio requirement to 50 percent from
 75 percent to help banks make credit available.  </p>
    <p>To further support the stability of the financial system, the 
start date for a regulatory change requiring higher capital for banks 
has been postponed for 12 months, to July 2021 (to support up to about 
NZ$47 billion of additional lending), with other regulatory initiatives 
in the pipeline also put on hold for at least six months. The RNBZ has 
also agreed with the banks that during this period there will be no 
dividend payments on ordinary shares and redemption of non-CET1 capital 
instruments. The RBNZ has removed, effective as of May 1, mortgage 
loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions for the next 12 months.</p>
    <p>The New Zealand government, the RBNZ, and the New Zealand Bankers
 Association have also announced a number of financial measures to 
support SMEs and homeowners. These include six-month principal and 
interest repayment deferrals to mortgage holders and SMEs affected by 
COVID-19 and the BFGS. </p>
    <p>Other related measures taken by the government that could 
contribute to financial stability include a six-month freeze on 
residential rent increases until September 25 and restrictions against 
tenancy terminations during March-June. The Business Debt Hibernation 
process allows businesses to place their existing debts on hold for up 
to seven months.</p>

<h3>Nicaragua</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 19, 2020. In response to the COVID-19, the government 
announced the implementation of several measures, including the creation
 of an inter-institutional commission, the declaration of a state of 
national alert, and the implementation of Epidemiological Surveillance 
Protocols at the national level. </p>
<p>The Ministry of Health (MINSA) monitors and provides weekly reports 
on the status of the outbreaks in the country. A total of 19 hospitals 
have been officially designated nationwide for the care of COVID-19 
cases upon detection. Doctors and relevant health personnel from MINSA 
have received training on the prevention, detection, containment and 
treatment of COVID-19 and have exchanged experiences on these topics 
with international experts. Education on the prevention of the COVID-19 
is also taking place at the national level and a National Information 
Center has been set up with free direct telephone lines for emergency 
calls and to answer queries related to the virus, including preventive 
information.</p>
<p>The central and local governments launched a cleaning and 
disinfection program of public schools, public transportation units, 
taxis, markets and other public spaces at a national level. In addition,
 MINSA is promoting a campaign to take preventive measures including 
proper hand washing, adequate use of masks and the care of vulnerable 
groups, such as the elderly and with chronic diseases.</p>
<p>On July 13, the MINSA issued revised guidelines to strengthen 
epidemiological controls at all entry points into the country, 
including: (i) travelers must have a negative PCR test result for 
COVID-19 taken in a period not exceeding 72 hours before arriving to the
 country; (ii) non-national travelers who have fever or respiratory 
symptoms may not enter the country; (iii) Nicaraguan nationals who have 
fever or respiratory symptoms may enter the country, but they have to 
observe house quarantine; and (iv) all travelers who present a negative 
PCR test upon arrival and have no respiratory symptoms will be allowed 
without restrictions but will be follow up by telephone by health 
personnel for a period of fourteen days.</p>
<p>On the same date, the Nicaraguan Institute of Civil Aeronautics 
(INAC) informed that Nicaragua is ready to resume commercial air 
operations if airlines comply with MINSA revised guidelines. Air 
operators must present their COVID-19 plans to INAC before resuming 
commercial operations.</p>

    <p>An updated crisis response plan has been presented to donors with
 an estimated cost of 18.4 percent of GDP, divided into an immediate 
health response and broader economic and social mitigation. Key elements
 are already being implemented, such as food distribution, two months of
 free utilities to the vulnerable households and temporary tax relief 
for hard-hit sectors.  Finance Ministry also announced credit support to
 the private sector in the form of loan guarantees. The revised cost 
includes large-scale support for agricultural production, revenue 
shortfalls, and the building of liquidity buffers. On May 8, the cabinet
 approved a supplementary budget with 1.3 percent of GDP in resources 
re-allocated to additional spending toward health, security and social 
assistance. </p>
    <p>On April 27, Heads of states of the West-Africa Economic and 
Monetary Union (WAEMU) declared a temporary suspension of the WAEMU 
Growth and Stability Pact setting six convergence criteria, including 
the 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit rule, to help member-countries cope 
with the fallout of COVID-19. This temporary suspension will allow 
member-countries to raise their overall fiscal deficit temporarily and

    <p>The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic 
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks’ 
demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on
 economic activity. The BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a 
fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby 
allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25
 basis points lower than before the crisis. On June 22, the Monetary 
Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the
 monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO 
has also: (i) extended the collateral framework to access central bank 
refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private 
companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance 
institutions to accommodate demands from customers with Covid19-related 
repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period debt 
service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims 
as non-performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of 
electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched in April 2020 a 
special 3-month refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for 
limited amounts of 3-month "Covid-19 T-Bills" to be issued by each WAEMU
 sovereign to help meet immediate funding needs related to the current 
pandemic. The amount of such special T-Bills by Niger is equivalent to 
1.4 percent of GDP. Niger has been recently allowed to issue the 
equivalent of 1.3 percent of GDP of new 3-months Covid-19 T-Bills that 
banks may refinance with the BCEAO for their term to maturity at 2 
percent. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the 
five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basle II/III 
bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital 
adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 
9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead
 of 2022 initially planned. </p>

<h3>Nigeria</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Nigeria has been severely hit by the 
spread of COVID-19 and the associated sharp decline in oil prices. 
Government policy is responding to both these developments. A range of 
measures have been implemented to contain the spread of the virus, 
including closure of international airports, public and private schools,
 universities, stores and markets, and suspension of public gatherings. A
 “lockdown” was declared in Lagos, Abuja and Ogun states. Work at home 
is also encouraged in several states and government institutions while 
isolation centers are being expanded in Lagos state. Testing capacity is
 increasing as NCDC now deploys digital platforms for people to get 
results sooner. The president ordered the release of inmates in 
correctional facilities to decongest prisons.  On May 4, the phase 1 of 
three-phase economic re-opening commenced following a full lockdown that
 had been placed since March 30. The phase 1 moved to phase 2 on June 
2—allowing most offices and schools to reopen. However, a comprehensive 
list of restrictions remains in place, including night time curfew, ban 
on non-essential inter-state passenger travel, partial and controlled 
interstate movement of goods and services, and mandatory use of face 
masks or coverings in public. On September 4, Nigeria transitioned into 
phase 3 for a period of four weeks. Night curfew has been reduced to 
12am – 4am. Groups of up to 50 people are allowed to attend parties and 
gathering. More opening hours are allowed for parks and gardens but 
clubs and bars remain closed.   </p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Contingency funds of N984 million ($2.7 million) have been 
released to Nigeria’s Center for Disease Control, and an additional N6.5
 billion ($18 million) was distributed for purchasing more testing kits,
 opening isolation centers and training medical personnel. Grant of N10 
billion ($28 million) was released to the Lagos State to increase its 
capacity to contain the outbreak. Import duty waivers for pharmaceutical
 firms were introduced. Regulated fuel prices have been reduced, and an 
automatic fuel price formula introduced to ensure fuel subsidies are 
eliminated. Electricity tariffs have been increased. The President also 
ordered an increase of the social register by 1 million households to 
3.6 million to help cushion the effect of the lockdown. The Federal 
Government adopted a revised budget for 2020 in response to the COVID-19
 shock. A N500 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) COVID-19 intervention fund 
is included in the revised budget to channel resources to additional 
health-related current and capital spending (tests, supplies and 
facilities) and public works programs to support the incomes of the 
vulnerable. The coverage of the conditional cash transfer program has 
been broadened and an allocation of N150 billion to support state and 
local governments’ spending needs has been made available through the 
budget. They have also unveiled a N2.3 trillion stimulus package which 
focuses on job-intensive projects including in agricultural, road, and 
housing sectors—a bulk of which is to be financed from CBN-supported 
credit facilities and from sovereign wealth and other savings funds.    </p>

<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>In response to the crisis, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) cut 
monetary policy rate by 100 basis points in May while expanding 
liquidity available for nonbank financial institutions, leading to 
significant lowering of market yield of government securities. It also 
introduced additional measures, including: (i) reducing interest rates 
on all applicable CBN interventions from 9 to 5 percent and introducing a
 one year moratorium on CBN intervention facilities; (ii) creating a N50
 billion ($139 million)  targeted credit facility; and (iii) liquidity 
injection of 3.6 trillion (2.4 percent of GDP) into the banking system, 
including N100 billion to support the health sector, N2 trillion to the 
manufacturing sector, and N1.5 trillion to the real sector to impacted 
industries. Regulatory forbearance was also introduced to restructure 
loans in impacted sectors. The CBN is also coordinating a private sector
 special intervention initiative targeting N120 billion ($333 million) 
to fight COVID-19. As of April 16, N42.6 billion was received, including
 $50 million grant from the European Union.  In July, the CBN retained 
the monetary policy rate.  In September, the CBN cut the monetary policy
 rate by 100 basis points. </p>

    <p>The official exchange rate was adjusted from N307/$ before 
COVID-19 to N361/$ at the beginning of the crisis and more recently to 
N380/$, with an ongoing unification of the various exchange rates under 
the investors and exporters (I&amp;E) window, Bureau de Change, and 
retail and wholesale windows. The authorities committed to let the 
I&amp;E rate move in line with market forces. A few pharmaceutical 
companies have been identified to ensure they can receive FX and naira 
funding. While I&amp;E window turnover has been low since April, the CBN
 has resumed FX supply in some of the other windows.</p>

<h3>North Macedonia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed case in North 
Macedonia was reported on February 26. The number of new daily cases 
picked up in June and continues to be relatively high. After a strict 
lockdown, the government is taking measures to gradually reopen the 
economy, but important social-distancing restrictions remain in place to
 slow down contagion. Reflecting the impact of the containment measures,
 GDP contracted by 12.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter.</p>

    <p>The government has adopted fiscal measures to help address firms’
 liquidity problems, protect jobs and support the most vulnerable. The 
measures, which are temporary, include subsidies on private sector wages
 and social security contributions for firms that maintain employment, 
postponement of income tax payments, loans at favorable terms and loan 
guarantees, and sector-specific support. Also, vulnerable households 
have received financial support through existing social assistance 
schemes and cash vouchers. Students will receive partial re-imbursement 
of university tuition fees and IT courses. Finally, the government has 
implemented price controls on basic food products, medicines, and 
disinfection products, and abolished the import duty on medical 
supplies.</p>

cut its policy rate twice since the start of the crisis by a cumulative 
50 basis points to 1.5 percent. The fees for withdrawing and returning 
cash to the National Bank’s central vault have been abolished to 
minimize any risk of transmitting the virus infection by coins and 
bills. In addition, the NBRNM has reduced by 60 percent the amount of CB
 bills offered to banks, thus providing additional liquidity to the 
economy. On financial sector measures, the NBRNM has revised its credit 
risk regulation, to encourage banks to restructure loans temporarily 
(initially through September 2020, but recently extended through March 
2021), and has relaxed the loan classification standards for NPLs. It 
has also reduced the base for the reserve requirement by the amount of 
new loans to firms in affected sectors and has extended the deadline for
 banks to submit their first Internal Liquidity Assessment Report in 
order to allow them to focus on providing credit while maintaining the 
quality of the loan portfolio. </p>

<h3>Norway</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on February 26 ,2020. The virus continued to spread, with the 
number of new cases reaching its peak at the end of March, but it has 
fallen strongly since then. The government had implemented a range of 
measures to mitigate the spread of coronavirus and to stabilize the 
economy. The former included travel restrictions, a 
quarantine-after-travel requirement, social distancing measures, and 
closures of schools, universities and businesses. </p>
<p>On May 7, 2020, the government announced its plan to reopen the 
economy, with a gradual timeline that remains dependent on keeping the 
spread of infection under control. Accordingly, employers of operating 
businesses are required to ensure at least one-meter distance between 
coworkers, bars can reopen under similar one meter social distancing 
rule, meetings up to 20 people and public events up to 50 are now 
permitted, all primary and secondary schools are reopened, and 
quarantine requirements are reduced. In addition, non-essential travel 
to and from other Nordic and EEA countries have resumed subject to the 
quarantine requirements and conditional on the infection rate and the 
containment measures in place.   </p>

<h3>Oman</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Oman is being hit by two shocks—the 
spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in oil prices. Government 
policy is responding to both these developments. The number of 
registered COVID-19 cases stands at 94,711 as of September 22. The 
authorities have implemented a range of measures to try and limit the 
spread of the virus encompassing travel restrictions (including on 
international flights and internal public transportation and taxis), 
partial lockdowns, suspending prayers at mosques, closing all schools, 
universities, shopping malls and commercial establishments (except for 
groceries, pharmacies, food delivery, and gas stations), and limiting 
employee attendance at government workplaces and private businesses to 
minimum needed. On April 15, the government approved measures aiming to 
maintain the employment of Omani nationals and support private sector 
firms, including by encouraging them to advance paid annual leave and 
negotiate salary cuts. For Omani employees whose salaries are lowered, 
their bank loans will be rescheduled without interest or additional fees
 for three months, fuel subsidies provided, and electricity and water 
bills postponed until the end of June 2020. Incentives offered to 
affected private sector firms include postponement of electricity and 
water fees for three months.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On April 28, the 
government discussed proposals that consider public health and support 
the reopening of some business activities and decided to open some 
commercial activities including car servicing, repair, and rental, money
 exchanges, outlets selling electrical and electronic appliances, 
printing houses and quarries. On May 27 government decided to end the 
lockdown of the Muscat governorate, let private sector employees return 
to their offices and government agencies to begin regular operations on 
May 31. On June 10 and June 23 the government further opened up 
commercial and industrial activities. On July 14, the government decided
 to facilitate Oman citizens’ travel abroad, on condition that they 
abide by the precautionary procedures but also decided to extend the 
lockdown on Governorate of Dhofar and the Wilayat of Masirah. On July 
25, Oman entered into a major nationwide lockdown aimed at limiting the 
spread of COVID-19, which was lifted on August 7. Following the approval
 from the Supreme Committee tasked with tackling developments resulting 
from Covid-19, the government decided to resume public transport 
services in a phased manner starting from September 27. </p>

    <p>Because the decline in oil prices will result in a loss of 
government revenue, the authorities have announced that they will reduce
 spending in the 2020 budget by 10 percent (about 5 percent of GDP). The
 government announced several measures to support the economy on March 
19. These include the suspension of municipal taxes and some government 
fees (till end-August) and rent payments for companies in industrial 
zones (for the next three months), reduction of port and air freight 
charges, as well as postponement of loan servicing for borrowers of Oman
 Development Bank and SME support fund for six months. On April 1, the 
Tax Authority announced a package of measures that include the waiving 
of fines and penalties for late disclosures, allowing the paying of 
taxes in instalments, and the deduction of donations made to combat the 
coronavirus. On June 23 the government authorized a program of 
interest-free emergency loans to assist some segments of entrepreneurs

<h3>Pakistan</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on February 26, 2020. COVID-19 spread rapidly in Pakistan 
hitting the peak in June, before slowing down in July. The number of 
daily new cases in August and September has been consistently less than 
1,000 as compared to the peak of 6,000 new daily cases in mid-June. 
Starting on March 23, both the federal and provincial governments 
implemented measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus. 
These included selective quarantines, border closures with neighboring 
countries, international and domestic travel restrictions, school and 
university closures, banning of public events, social distancing 
measures, and varying levels of lockdown across the country.  The 
government repatriated migrant workers stranded abroad, many of whom 
have tested positive for the coronavirus. The economic activity worsened
 notably, and growth is preliminarily estimated at –0.4 percent in FY 
2020. A gradual recovery is expected in FY 2021 as the economy reopens.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Since mid-April, the 
federal government, in coordination with provinces, has gradually eased 
lockdown arrangements, by allowing ‘low-risk industries’ to restart 
operation and ‘small retail shops’ to reopen with newly developed 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). In addition, restrictions on 
domestic and international movements have been lifted (e.g. domestic 
flights, train services, and international flights have resumed). 
Lockdown restrictions have been lifted across all provinces, and 
economic activity has been allowed to fully resume with the 
implementation of SOPs starting from August 10. Educational institutes 
as well as recreational places, restaurants, malls and retail outlets 
have reopened starting from September 15. </p>

    <p>A relief package worth PKR 1.2 trillion was announced by the 
federal government on March 24, which has been almost fully implemented.
 Key measures include: (i) elimination of import duties on emergency 
health equipment; (ii) cash transfers to 6.2 million daily wage workers 
(PKR 75 billion); (iii) cash transfers to more than 12 million 
low-income families (PKR 150 billion), which has been fully executed; 
(iv) accelerated tax refunds to the export industry (PKR 100 billion), 
out of which 65 percent have already been disbursed; and (v) financial 
support to SMEs and the agriculture sector (PKR 100 billion) in the form
 of power bill deferment, bank lending, as well as subsidies and tax 
incentives. The economic package also earmarks resources for an 
accelerated procurement of wheat (PKR 280 billion, almost fully executed
 to date), financial support to utility stores (PKR 50 billion), a 
reduction in regulated fuel prices (with a benefit for end consumers 
estimated at PKR 70 billion), support for health and food supplies (PKR 
15 billion), electricity bill payments relief (PKR 110 billion), an 
emergency contingency fund (PKR 100 billion), and a transfer to the 
National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) for the purchase of 
COVID-19 related equipment (PKR 25 billion). The unexecuted part of the 
relief package will be carried forward to FY2021. In addition, the FY 
2021 budget&nbsp; includes further increases in health and social 
spending, tariff and custom duty reductions on food items, an allocation
 for ‘COVID-19 Responsive and Other Natural Calamities Control Program’ 
(PKR 70 billion), a housing package to subsidize mortgages (PKR 30 
billion), as well as the provision of tax incentives to the construction
 sector (retail and cement companies) to address the acute employment 
needs generated by the lockdowns.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Since the onset of the crisis, provincial governments have also 
been implementing supportive fiscal measures through June 2020, 
consisting of cash grants to low-income households, tax relief, and 
additional health spending (including a salary increase for healthcare 
workers). For instance, the government of Punjab’s measures included a 
PKR 18 billion tax relief package and a PKR 10 billion cash grants 
program. The government of Sindh’s measures included cash grant and 
ration distribution program of PKR 1.5 billion for low-income 
households. The FY2021 budgets for provincial governments also provide 
tax relaxations and sizeable increases in expenditure allocations, 
especially on health services, to mitigate Covid-19 effects.</p>

facilities and  introduced three new ones to: (i) support hospitals and 
medical centers to purchase equipment to detect, contain, and treat 
COVID-19 (34 hospitals, PKR 6.3 billion, to date); (ii) stimulate 
investment in new manufacturing plants and machinery, as well as 
modernization and expansion of existing projects (118 new projects, PKR 
78 billion, to date); (iii) incentivize businesses to avoid laying off 
their workers during the pandemic (2,633 firms , PKR 213billion, to 
date).</p>
    <p>Moreover, the SBP introduced temporary regulatory measures to 
maintain banking system soundness and sustain economic activity. These 
include: (i) reducing the capital conservation buffer by 100 basis 
points to 1.5 percent; (ii) increasing the regulatory limit on extension
 of credit to SMEs by 44 percent to PRs 180 million ; (iii) relaxing of 
the debt burden ratio for consumer loans from 50 percent to 60 percent; 
(iv) allowing banks to defer clients’ payment of principal on loan 
obligations by one year (with a total of PKR 651 billion being deferred 
to date); (v) relaxing regulatory criteria for restructured loans for 
borrowers who require relief beyond the extension of principal repayment
 for one year; and (vi) suspending bank dividends for the first two 
quarters of 2020 to shore up capital. More recently, the SBP has 
introduced mandatory targets for banks to ensure loans to construction 
activities account for at least 5 percent of the private sector 
portfolios by December 2021.  </p>

<h3>Panama</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Panama reported its first confirmed case
 of COVID-19 on March 10, 2020. Since then, the authorities implemented 
prompt and strict containment measures. They declared a national 
emergency on March 13; set a sanitary fence around affected areas; 
ordered mandatory quarantine with a 24-hour curfew (replaced with a 7 
pm-5 am curfew starting June 1) with gender-based movement restrictions 
(April 1-May 31, resumed on June 8); suspended all construction projects
 except health-related; closed schools; canceled events; and banned all 
commercial flights (except cargo and humanitarian). The suspension of 
flights started with outbound flights to Europe and Asia (on March 14), 
extending to all commercial international flights (March 22) and later 
to all domestic flights with the grounding of Copa Airlines (from March 
23) and Air Panama (from March 25). The government authorized limited 
reopening of Tocumen Airport, with several Copa flights scheduled for a 
second fortnight of August, and plan to restart regular flights on 
September 4. All labor contracts of closed businesses were suspended. On
 July 14, the government formalized a reduction of working hours up to 
50 percent per month.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.minsa.gob.pa/sites/default/files/publicacion-general/lineamientos_para_el_retorno_a_la_normalidad_de_las_empresas_post-covid-19_en_panama_vc.pdf" target="_blank">guidelines for “return to normality post COVID-19"</a>,
 published on the website of the Ministry of Health, cover key points 
that public institutions and private companies must comply with to 
ensure workers’ safety. On May 15, the Ministry of Labor and Development
 (Mitradel) published the guidelines for the gradual reopening of 
companies and reinstatement of workers. Companies that are authorized to
 reopen may request Mitradel to extend labor contacts suspensions which 
may not exceed four months in total. On August 19, Mitradel extended the
 validity of work permits for foreign workers that expire between March 
and September 2020 by 6 months.</p>
<p>On September 7, the government authorized a gradual reopening of the 
construction industry (with up to 500 workers for each project, subject 
to safety precautions and limitations on working hours), the Panama 
Pacific Special Economic Area, the Colon Free Zone and other free zones,
 as well as the operations of private marinas, tailor and dressmaker 
shops, shoe stores and car washes.</p>
<p>In addition, &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mobility restriction by gender ended on September 14;</li>
    <li>International commercial flights resumed on September 21 
(incoming passengers must provide a negative COVID-19 test result to 
gain entry to Panama);</li>
    <li>The curfew will continue from 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m., Monday 
through Saturday. On Sunday, quarantine measures will continue in Panama
 and Panama Oeste. This measure will be lifted on October 12.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<p>Amid the pandemic-related increase in healthcare and social spending,
 and with SFRL limits temporarily relaxed, the NFPS deficit is expected 
to rise to 6¼ percent of GDP in 2020, which is 3½ percent of GDP (some 
US$2.1 billion) higher than the budget. The package of fiscal measures 
includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Expenditure side: (i) higher spending on healthcare needs, 
including building a new hospital, purchases of medical supplies and 
equipment, test kits and educational materials, and training medical 
personnel. On July 14, the Cabinet approved US$133.7 million to purchase
 medical supplies; (ii) an augmentation in social spending, including 
payments to affected workers and small business owners through the 
"Panama Solidarity Plan" with in-kind transfers including basic food 
supplies, and several programs (such as Opportunity Banking, Guarantee 
Fund, and the Soft Loan program) jointly valued at US$ 235 million, 
aimed at supporting the micro, small and medium-sized companies in 
restarting operations and continuing to employ workers; (iii) a 
suspension of payments for public services (electricity, landline 
phones, mobile phone and internet) for March-June; (iv) an electricity 
subsidy (50 percent to customers who consume up to 300 kWh per month and
 30 percent to those who consume between 301 kWh and 1,000 kWh per 
month); (v) an expansion of the Housing Solidarity Fund program managed 
by the Ministry of Housing and Land Management, which provides $10,000 
towards a down payment to the families in need for homes of up to 
US$70,000 (reinforced with US$80 million from the Panama Savings Fund). 
The Government extended the electricity subsidy for three months, 
starting July 1, estimated at a cost of more than US$250 million. The 
Panama Solidarity Plan has already benefited more than 1.5 million 
people. On August 23, the government began the transfer of US$50 to 
approximately 250,000 workers with suspended contracts, amounting to a 
total of US$12.5 million.</li>
    <li>Revenue side: (i) tax relief through extended income-tax filing 
deadlines until December 31, 2020 (originally until July 17). MEF is 
also proposing a 10 percent discount to individuals and entities who 
declare and pay their tax obligations early, under the program called 
“Pronto Pago”; (ii) some tax benefits and suspension of payments for 
public services (for 4 months, without interest) for taxpayers with 
income below US$2,000 per month, retirees, or those displaced from the 
labor market; and (iv) enabling 114 virtual procedures for taxpayers.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, Panama mobilized: (i) US$515 million from the IMF under the 
Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI); (ii) US$300 million from the 
Inter-American Development Bank (US$150 to finance micro and small 
businesses, and another US$150 million to help agricultural producers); 
(iii) US$41 million in the Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option from the
 World Bank to expand the coronavirus care network; (iv) a US$1 million 
grant from the Central American Bank for Economic Integration to finance
 COVID-19 prevention activities; and (v) a US$400,000 grant from the 
Development Bank of Latin America to acquire ventilators. The President 
approved a law which allows the government to use liquid resources of 
the Panama Savings Fund (assets of US$1.3 billion). On July 9, the IDB 
approved another US$400 million loan to help finance efforts to contain 
the COVID-19 pandemic, mitigate its impact on vulnerable households, and
 promote policies to mitigate short-term adverse effects on the economy.
 On August 4, the National Bank of Panama issued a US$1 billion 10-years
 bond at 2.5 percent in international markets. On September 23, the 
government raised another US$2.575 billion in global bonds, comprising 
new bond (US$1.25 billion; maturing in 2032; yield of 2.252%), reopening
 of a bond maturing in 2060 (US$1 billion; yield of 3.28%), and 
reopening of a local note maturing in 2026 (US$0.325 billion; yield of 
2.77%). The government also withdrew an additional US$20 million from 
the Panama Savings Fund (FAP), earmarked for future acquisition of a 
COVID-19 vaccine, bringing total withdrawals to US$105 million since the
 declaration of emergency following the pandemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<p>The Superintendency of Banks of Panama (SBP) allowed banks to use the
 accumulated dynamic provisioning (about US$1.3 billion or 2 percent of 
GDP) to absorb the impact of credit losses. It allowed banks to 
undertake voluntary loan restructuring with troubled borrowers (banks 
can adjust existing loan conditions, grant grace periods, reduce 
interest rates, and eliminate some fees) and requested banks not to 
charge interest on unpaid interest. To provide relief to borrowers 
affected by the pandemic, banks agreed to extend grace periods on loan 
payments until December 31, 2020 (from 90-120 days offered earlier). 
This agreement was later enshrined in Law 156 dated June 30, which 
established a formal moratorium on loans granted by banks, cooperatives 
and finance companies for all natural and legal persons economically 
affected by the national emergency due to the pandemic. Borrowers have 
to continue paying interest, but banks will not apply late fees, charge 
interest on unpaid interest, or record late payments in credit history. 
The measure applies to mortgages, personal, auto, credit card loans, and
 loans to SMEs, agriculture, commerce, and transport. The moratorium is 
not automatic: borrowers must provide documents on the impact of the 
pandemic on their employment or business activities. July 1 is the start
 of the second phase of the moratorium (which includes additional grace 
periods and loan renegotiations or consolidations), with applications 
availaible online.</p>
<p>On August 6, The World Bank Group’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee
 Agency (MIGA) issued a guarantee on loans received by Caja de Ahorros 
de Panamá amounting to US$400 million to support affordable housing and 
loans to SMEs. The guarantee is for: (i) a US$250 million loan (maturity
 of 15 years) from Kairos Global Solutions S.A. (Kairos); and (ii) a 
US$150 million (maturity of 5 years) from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya 
Argentaria, S.A. (BBVA).</p>
<p>On August 7, the MEF and National Bank of Panama established two Trusts as part of the economic reactivation strategy.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first Trust, named "Global Credit Program for the Defense of
 the Productive Fabric and Employment", aims to support micro-, small, 
and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in the face of the COVID-19 crisis.
 The initial funding will amount to US$150 million from the IDB and will
 be replenished in a second phase in 2021.</li>
    <li>The second Trust, called "Special Bank Stimulus Fund", is 
intended to grant credit facilities to productive sectors to stimulate 
economic growth and meet temporary liquidity needs. The initial funding 
of US$500 million comes from the IMF’s RFI.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Panama is a fully dollarized economy; BOP is expected to 
deteriorate as a result of the COVID-19 shock given a fall in tourism, 
transit through the Panama Canal and lower foreign direct investment. 
The Cabinet dropped import tariffs on corn used to feed animals (from 40
 percent) until December 31, 2020.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Other</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Some private parties offer economic relief to their clients 
affected by the outbreak (e.g., the Association of Property Owners of 
Panama approved a suspension of evictions of tenants affected by 
COVID-19, effective April 1), Minera Panama donated 20 ventilators and a
 gasometer for the Social Security Administration’s Special Respiratory 
Care Unit, while insurance companies voluntarily assumed coverage for 
COVID-19. </p>

<h3>Papua New Guinea </h3>
<p>Since early February, the PNG government has taken stringent measures
 to mitigate a domestic outbreak of COVID-19. Initially, these included a
 ban on travelers from Asian countries, reduced international flights, 
mandatory health declaration forms for incoming travelers and enhanced 
screening at designated ports of entries. On March 24th the authorities 
announced a State of Emergency (SoE), restricting internal bus and air 
travel, closure of bars, and work-from-home requirements. Following the 
lapse of the SoE in June, there has been a renewed outbreak of COVID-19,
 mainly centered on the National Capital District (NCD), but with a 
growing number of cases in other regions.  The Government has announced 
that domestic travel will only be allowed for essential services and a 
lockdown of 14 days has been implemented in the NCD.</p>
<p>On June 9, the IMF Executive Board approved the disbursement of 
US$363.6 million in emergency financing under the Rapid Credit Facility 
(RCF) to help PNG address urgent balance of payments needs created by 
COVID-19.</p>
<p>Press Release:  
https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/06/09/pr20238-papa-new-guinea-imf-executive-board-approves-disbursement-to-address-the-covid-19-pandemic</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong>On April 2, the PNG 
parliament voted to shut down the country and extended the SoE, for a 
further two months, until June 16 which enables return to normal 
operations. However, businesses are to implement ‘new normal’ work 
arrangements which includes physical distancing and use of face masks. 
PNG parliament also passed the Public Health Emergency Bill 2020 which 
seeks to provide a practical and effective legislative mechanism for the
 implementation of all necessary measures to detect, prevent the entry 
of, and eradication of pandemic, outbreak or serious public health 
threat.</p>

    <p>On April 2, the PNG government announced a K5.6 billion economic 
stimulus package in the parliament.  The government has announced K600 
million credit line to support businesses and individuals in 
coordination with the banks and financial institutions, and K500 million
 support from superannuation savings to employees affected by the 
economic slowdown. Moreover, the government has allocated K645 million 
more to support health, security and economic sector.  </p>

    <li>
    <p>The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) has reduced the Kina Facility
 Rate (KFR) – the main policy rate - by 200 basis points to 3 percent 
from 5 percent and has asked the commercial banks to reduce their 
respective Indicative Lending Rates. BPNG has also reduced the Cash 
Reserve Requirement to 7 percent from 10 percent to provide additional 
liquidity to the commercial banks. In addition, BPNG announced a program
 to repurchase government securities in the secondary market to provide 
liquidity to the private sector. To encourage interbank activity, BPNG 
has increased the margin on central bank borrowing by 25 basis point to 
100 basis points of both sides of KFR. All financial institutions have 
agreed to provide relief of 3 months on loan repayments and interest 
payments to customers who have lost their jobs on a case-by-case basis. 
To cover for the 3-month loan repayment holiday for borrowers severely 
affected by the COVID crisis, BPNG suspended loan-loss provisioning for 
affected loans during this period. A total of K806 million is expected 
to be paid out the members from their superannuation savings. The 
amendments to Superannuation Act which will allow its members to 
withdraw up to 20 percent of their contribution or a maximum of K10,000.</p>

<h3>Paraguay</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed
 in Paraguay on March 7th, 2020. The first confirmed cases were 
imported, though community and local transmissions quickly took off. 
Most cases in the past three months were imported from Brazil, although 
community transmission appears to have picked up significantly in 
August. Starting March 12, the government implemented a series of 
measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including border closure 
and suspension of school, all activities that involve groups of people, 
as well as public and private events. The country implemented a total 
quarantine from March 20 to May 3, 2020. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On June 15, 2020, Paraguay
 moved into the third stage of re-opening, under the country’s phased 
plan labeled “Smart Quarantine”. It allows the rehabilitation of 
commercial stores and shopping centers, corporate offices, general 
construction works, and sports in gyms at fresh air. Stage three also 
allows the reopening of restaurants.  The main remaining restrictions 
are border closures, cancellation of large public events, face mask 
requirements, and limited seating and extended sanitary protocols for 
restaurants, gyms, religious services, and public offices. 
Physical-presence school classes will remain suspended for the rest of 
the school year until December 2020. On July 20, the country moved to 
phase 4 of the reopening, which allows reopening of hotels under strict 
protocol, religious services with up to 50 persons and some further 
relaxation on public and private event protocols. However, the populous 
capital Asunción and Central Department will remain in phase 3 until at 
least August 30, and the government announced today that the smart 
quarantine in this area could even be scaled back to an earlier phase. 
Alto Paraná, the Department bordering Brazil, remains in phase 1, 
complemented by a stay-home order during curfew times.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of August 20, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government has lowered VAT on medical supplies to 5 percent 
and eliminated import tariffs on them. On March 23rd, 2020, the 
government submitted to congress a package of emergency spending 
measures of around $945 million (2.5 percent of GDP). The package 
includes additional health-related spending of $500 million, $400 
million measures to support the vulnerable population, and $45 million 
emergence funding for small enterprises. The government has asked 
Congress to authorize additional borrowing of up to U.S. $1.6 billion (4
 percent of GDP) from IFIs and through bond issuances. On April 23, the 
government successfully issued U.S.$1,000 million in international 
sovereign bonds. The 10-year bond was seven times oversubscribed at an 
interest rate of 4.95 percent.  </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Since early March, the central bank has lowered the policy rate 
by 325 basis points, to 0.75 percent. The interest rate for the central 
bank’s overnight liquidity facility window has also been reduced, by 200
 basis points, from 4.5 percent to 2.5 percent. The Central Bank has 
also reduced the minimum reserve requirements on domestic and foreign 
currency deposits, freeing up $959 million in the process for banks to 
make new loans. In addition, a National Emergency Special Credit 
Facility (FCE) was created to channel up to $760 million in liquidity 
support to SMEs. The government has also allowed banks to automatically 
refinance loans to private sector companies that are in repayment 
difficulties, and postponed collection of taxes and user fees for 2 
months.</p>
    <p>The Development Finance Agency (AFD) has started programs to help
 refinance home loans for a period of 60 months, and to help SMEs 
finance working capital needs. A US$ 500 million MSME Guarantee Fund has
 been set up to support credit creation in the SME sector.</p>

    <li>
    <p>The central bank is continuing with its policy of letting the 
exchange rate absorb shocks, and have its value determined by market

<h3>Peru</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed
 in Peru on March 6th. The number of new cases has remained elevated, 
which led the government on August 13 to reimpose some of the 
restrictions that had been eased when the nation-wide lockdown was 
lifted on June 30. In particular, the government reinstated a ban on 
family and social gatherings and a national curfew for Sundays (the 
latter was eased in mid-September). Furthermore, the government added 
focalized lockdowns in 36 provinces across the country. Other 
restrictions remain in place, such as: (i) nationwide lockdowns for 
specific age groups (over 65 and under 14 years); (ii) closure of 
national borders; and (iii) nightly curfews. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government approved 3 billion soles (0.5 percent of GDP) to 
attend the health emergency and approximately 7 billion soles (1.1 
percent of GDP) in direct transfers to support vulnerable households 
during the national lockdown period. An additional cash transfer to 
vulnerable households of approximately 6.4 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) 
was announced in late July. The government also approved a three-month 
extension for the income tax declaration for SMEs and is granting 
flexibility to enterprises and households in the repayment of tax 
liabilities. These tax measures are estimated to provide a temporary 
relief in the order of 2.0 percent of GDP. The government has also 
approved the creation of an 800 million soles (or 0.1 percent of GDP) 
fund to help qualified SMEs to secure working capital and/or refinance 
debts and has announced an expansion of that program to around 0.5 
percent of GDP. The government has announced a postponement of 
households’ payments of electricity and water and a subsidy for 
electricity payments of 800 million soles (0.1 percent of GDP). The 
government’s approved fiscal support package is of over 7 percent of 
GDP.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The central bank has cut the policy rate by 200 basis points, 
bringing it to ¼ percent, and is monitoring inflation developments and 
its determinants in order to increase the monetary stimulus if 
necessary. In addition, the central bank has reduced reserve 
requirements, provided liquidity to the financial system through repo 
operations, and has approved a package of 60 billion soles (over 8.8 
percent of GDP) in liquidity assistance (backed by government 
guarantees) to support lending and the payments chain. The 
superintendence of banks has issued a notification allowing financial 
institutions to modify the terms of their loans to households and 
enterprises affected by the Covid-19 outbreak without changing the 
classification of the loans. These operations have to satisfy well 
defined conditions, including a maximum modification period of six 
months.</p>

<h3>Philippines</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The Philippines reported its first cases
 of confirmed COVID-19 on January 30, 2020. Starting on August 19, the 
government moved Metro Manila and other high-risk areas from a “modified
 enhanced community quarantine” to a “general community quarantine,” 
which allows more businesses to reopen and mass transportation to resume
 in phases. International travel restrictions largely remain in place, 
but domestic flights are allowed under limited capacity. </p>
<p>Financial market volatility has subsided recently, with the peso/US$ 
exchange rate staying stable. Meanwhile, real GDP in the first quarter 
and second quarter of 2020 contracted by 0.7 percent and 16.5 percent, 
respectively, on a year-on-year basis. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<p>The government launched a 4-pillar socioeconomic strategy against 
COVID-19, which includes support to vulnerable groups and individuals, 
expanded resources for frontline medical workers, as well as fiscal and 
monetary measures. </p>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government launched a PHP 595.6 billion fiscal package (about
 3.1 percent of 2019 GDP) for vulnerable individuals and groups, which 
includes the following measures that had been implemented during the 
first half of 2020: (1) PHP 205 billion cash aid program (1.1 percent of
 2019 GDP) for 18 million low-income households; (2) over PHP 56 billion
 social protection measures for vulnerable workers, including for 
displaced and overseas Filipino workers (0.3 percent of 2019 GDP); (3) 
over PHP 54 billion on COVID-19-related medical response (0.3 percent of
 2019 GDP); and (4) PHP 120 billion (0.6 percent of 2019 GDP) credit 
guarantee for small businesses and support to the agriculture sector. 
Financial assistance will also be provided to affected micro-, small-, 
and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) and vulnerable households through 
specialized microfinancing loans and loan restructuring. The “Bayanihan 
II” Act, which has been signed into law on September 11, is expected to 
provide additional fiscal support (about 0.8 percent of 2019 GDP) to 
vulnerable households and to workers and businesses in hard-hit 
industries, such as agriculture, transportation, and tourism. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has reduced its policy rate
 four times in 2020 by a cumulative 175 bps to 2.25 percent and lowered 
the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks by 200 bps to 12 
percent, effective from April 3. </p>
    <p>To support the government’s programs to counter the impacts of 
COVID 19, the BSP purchased PHP 300 billion worth government securities 
(about 1.5 percent of 2019 GDP) through a repurchase agreement with the 
government, made secondary market purchases of government securities, 
and remitted PHP 20 billion as dividend to the government even though it
 is no longer required to make dividend payments to the government under
 the newly amended BSP charter. The BSP has also announced a series of 
regulatory relief measures for the banking sector, including: (1) a 
temporary relaxation of requirements on compliance reporting, penalties 
on required reserves, and single borrower limits; (2) easier access to 
the BSP’s rediscounting facility; (3) a temporary relaxation of 
provisioning requirements (subject to the BSP approval), and (4) a 
relaxation of prudential regulations regarding marking-to-market of debt
 securities. These relief measures are intended to encourage banks, in 
turn, to provide financial relief to their borrowers (e.g., temporary 
grace period for loan payments). To encourage extension of loans to 
enterprises, particularly, micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises 
(MSMEs), the BSP allowed loans to MSMEs to be counted as part of banks’ 
compliance with reserve requirements, temporarily reduced their credit 
risk weights to 50 percent, and assigned zero risk weight to loan 
exposures guaranteed by the Philippine Guarantee Corporation. Finally, 
the BSP increased the limit on banks’ real estate loan share from 20 
percent of their total loan portfolio (net of interbank loans) to 25 
percent.</p>

<h3>Poland, Republic of</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Poland reported its first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on March 5, 2020. After a pickup in new cases in August, 
the pace of increase in new cases has again slowed in September in 
September before rising again later in the month. Beginning in March, 
the government introduced containment measures including closures of 
schools, universities, restaurants, and all non-essential retail trade 
and service outlets, as well as bans on large gatherings, border 
controls, and travel restrictions. Following a quarter-on-quarter (q/q) 
contraction of 0.4 percent in Q1 2020, GDP contracted a further 8.9 
percent q/q in Q2, led by declines in private consumption and fixed 
investment. High-frequency indicators suggested that the rebound in 
economic activity leveled off in August. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On April 16, the 
government outlined a four-stage plan to reopen the economy. Starting on
 April 20 a larger number of people was allowed in shops and at 
religious gatherings, and public parks and forests were re-opened. The 
second phase of the lockdown easing plan was launched on May 4 with the 
re-opening of hotels and shopping malls (with limitations on the number 
of persons), the opening of daycares and pre-schools (as of May 6), as 
well as softening quarantine rules for cross-border workers and 
students. The third phase was launched on May 18, entailing reopening of
 restaurants, hairdressers and cosmetic salons, and permission for 
outdoor sport events with up to 50 persons with no audience. Grades 1-3 
in primary schools opened on May 25 with strict sanitary rules, with a 
maximum number of children allowed in class. The fourth stage started on
 May 30, with the opening of cinemas, playgrounds, and gyms, all with 
stricter sanitary regimes than normal. Outdoor events are allowed with 
up to 150 people, with social distancing or face masks. Internal EU 
borders were opened on June 13, in with line EU recommendations. On 
August 6, given the deterioration in pandemic indicators, Ministry of 
Health decided to tighten sanitary rules in some regions; new rules 
reintroduce obligatory face masks outdoors, reduce number of persons 
allowed at gatherings and impose a ban on public events. </p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<p>New budgetary measures have been legislated, estimated at PLN 104 
billion (4.6 percent of GDP). New credit guarantees and micro loans for 
entrepreneurs estimated at PLN 75 billion (3.3 percent of GDP) were also
 approved. Additionally, the Polish Development Fund will finance a PLN 
100 billion (4.5 percent of GDP) liquidity program for businesses. Key 
measures include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Additional funds for hospital equipment and supplies;</li>
    <li>Wage subsidies for employees of affected businesses and 
self-employed persons. Businesses, regardless of their size, may apply 
for a three-month subsidy in the event of work stoppages or reduced 
working time. This subsidy covers social insurance contributions, and it
 ranges from 50 to 90 percent of the minimum wage for each employee, 
depending on recorded decrease in turnover in 2020. The subsidy includes
 furloughed employees.</li>
    <li>Increased guarantees from the national development bank (BGK) 
for enterprises. A new Liquidity Guarantee Fund in BGK will be 
established offering guarantees for loans taken by medium and large 
companies;</li>
    <li>Additional loans for micro-firms;</li>
    <li>Postponement or cancellation of social insurance contributions. 
For micro firms with up to 9 employees social insurance contributions 
are covered by the budget for 3 months. For companies employing from 10 
to 49 employees, 50 percent of social insurance contributions is paid by
 the budget. Possible deferral, payment in installments, or cancellation
 of taxes. The self-employed and employees working on civil law 
contracts can receive a one-time benefit.</li>
    <li>Deduction of this year’s losses for 2021 tax settlement (tax 
returns for 2019 might be corrected in order to deduct the losses of 
2020 from the 2019 income);</li>
    <li>An allowance for parents of young children related to school closures;</li>
    <li>A “solidarity benefit” for those who lost jobs after March 15, paid for three months (June-August);</li>
    <li>An increase in the unemployment benefit by 39 percent during the first 90 days of unemployment;</li>
    <li>To support the local tourism industry and families with 
children, a tourism voucher has been introduced, providing each child 
entitled to Family 500+ benefits with a one-time PLN 500 voucher to be 
spent at hotels or tourist events in Poland.</li>
    <li>Establishment of a new fund (COVID Fund) dedicated to combat the
 negative impact of the pandemic with the balance sheet size of PLN 100 
bn (revenues and expenditures at PLN 100 bn). The Fund is supervised by 
the Prime Minister but flows from the fund will be transferred to 
various ministers and other institutions involved in combating negative 
consequences of pandemic. Revenues are raised through the issuance of 
bonds by BGK (bonds are guaranteed by the State Treasury).</li>
    <li>Financial support of the investment tasks managed by local 
governments (under new government resolution up to PLN 12 bn will be 
dedicated to strengthening investments processes in local governments as
 a Governmental Fund for Local Investments). The support will be 
transferred to projects worth at least PLN 400000. The aim of new 
mechanism is to revive public investment in local government subsector. 
Financing will be ensured by the COVID Fund and as a result its balance 
sheet might be extended by additional PLN 12 bn (on the revenue and 
expenditure side),The local government could spend these funds until end
 of 2022. </li>
    <li>Interest rate subsidies for bank loans granted to provide 
financial liquidity to entrepreneurs affected by the COVID-19. The new 
fund in BGK is to be established (Subsidy Fund) with the purpose to 
support companies affected by pandemic through paying subsidies to lower
 their interest rate payments on loans granted by banks. Fiscal cost of 
new mechanism for 2020 budget will be at PLN 0.3 bn and will be covered 
by the COVID Fund.</li>
    <li>The Polish Development Fund is providing liquidity loans and 
subsidies for micro, small/medium, and large enterprises. The total 
value of the program equals PLN 100 billion. Approximately 60 percent of
 the financing may be non-returnable, upon fulfilling the relevant 
conditions related to maintaining employment, continuing business 
activity, and the level of lost sales.</li>
    <li>Foreign workers permits are extended to stay in Poland and work.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The National Bank of Poland (NBP) reduced its policy interest 
rate by 140 bps to 10 bps, with rate cuts on March 17 (50 bps), April 8 
(50 bps), and May 28 (40 bps), since March 17. The NBP has re-introduced
 repo (fine-tuning) operations to provide liquidity to banks, reduced 
the required reserve ratio from 3.5 to 0.5 percent, and changed the 
interest rate on required reserves to the level equal to the policy 
interest rate. The NBP has also begun purchases of Polish Treasury 
securities in the secondary market, and on April 8 expanded eligible 
securities to include those guaranteed by the State Treasury. The NBP 
has also introduced a program to provide funding for bank lending to 
enterprises. Through September 16 the NBP had purchased PLN 104.2 
billion (4.6 percent of GDP) in Treasury and in government guaranteed 
securities in the secondary market.</p>
    <p>In addition, the 3 percent systemic risk buffer for bank capital 
requirements has been repealed. The Polish Financial Supervisory 
Authority (PFSA) announced measures related to provisions and 
reclassification of loans to existing SMEs/micro  enterprises to allow 
distributing the impact of credit losses over a longer period. Some 
flexibility has been granted in how banks meet capital and liquidity 
requirements, and the PFSA is accepting the treatment of a BGK guarantee
 as fulfillment of the “special collateral” condition. The PFSA has 
adopted a flexible approach for the approval process of long-term 
guarantee measures under Solvency II for the insurance sector. The PFSA 
has also recommended a reduction in the risk weight for properties of 
borrowers that are not used for rentals, which would reduce bank capital
 requirements. Additionally, the Polish Banking Association has 
recommended voluntary deferral of loan payments for affected borrowers 
for up to three months. Banks have also increased limits for contactless
 credit cards.</p>

 including stores, restaurants/cafes, public-facing government services 
and school for certain age groups. Social distancing measures and the 
use of masks on public transport are mandatory. However, a recent pickup
 in cases has led to some tightening in social distancing rules, 
including limiting gatherings to a maximum of 10 people and preventing 
most commercial establishments from opening before 10am. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc22/governo/comunicado-de-conselho-de-ministros?i=368" target="_blank">State of Contingency</a> has been reactivated throughout mainland Portugal as of September 15.</p>

<h3>Qatar</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Qatar is being impacted by two 
shocks—the spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in hydrocarbon 
prices. The authorities are putting in place policies to address these. 
The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on February 29, 2020. 
Measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus include: travel 
restrictions (suspension of all international passenger flights, a 14 
day quarantine for all returning Qatari citizens, and suspension of 
public transportation); suspension of public and private schools 
(replaced with distance learning) and home services; closure of 
non-essential businesses (excluding groceries stores and pharmacies); 
banning all public gatherings and dining in cafes and restaurants; and 
cancellation of routine medical and dental appointments (except 
Well-baby, Vaccination Clinics, and Urgent Radiology and Ultrasound). 
These measures have been complemented by required teleworking for 80 
percent of private sector employees and vulnerable groups (older than 
55, pregnant women, and those with chronic illness), reduced working 
hours in the public sector, public health awareness campaigns, 
intensified food inspections to ensure health compliance, more testing 
for COVID-19 (including a drive through station), and disinfection of 12
 thousand square meters in the Industrial Area. Home delivery medical 
services have been expanded to contain the spread of COVID-19. The 
private sector is providing meals and hygiene baskets to workers in 
quarantined areas. A 150-bed hospital for quarantined workers has been 
set up in the Industrial Area, where there has been a high concentration
 of COVID-19 cases. Starting May 17, 2020 all citizens and residents are
 required to wear a facemask when out in public. Starting May 22, 2020 
all citizens and residents are required to install the Ehteraz App on 
their mobile phones before leaving their residence, which will help 
track COVID-19 transmission chains, help prioritize testing, and provide
 COVID-related updates.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the Economy.</strong> The authorities have 
conducted widespread COVID-19 testing in the Industrial Area and are 
providing free healthcare to those affected, including by transporting 
6,500 workers to a precautionary quarantine facility. Following these 
measures, the authorities fully opened the Industrial Area on May 6 
(after closure since mid-March and partial opening since late April), 
though under strict and specific entry and exit regulations, where only 
employers and employees are allowed to enter or exit, and goods and 
materials may only enter or exit with an application to relevant 
authorities. Entry and exit regulations are implemented, in part, by the
 use of a mobile application. On June 8, the government announced a 
4-phase plan to reopen the economy. On August 30, authorities announced 
new labor-market reforms that will dismantle the “kafala” employment 
system by allowing workers to take new jobs without their current 
employers’ approval; imposing a permanent, universal minimum wage; and 
beefing up enforcement systems around labor protections. On September 1,
 the economy moved into phase 4 with full economic activity largely 
restored, including with schools, public buildings, and business 
reopening with social distancing and medical precautions in place.  </p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<p>Qatar’s QAR 75 billion ($20.6 billion or about 13 percent of GDP) 
package to reduce the effects of COVID-19 was announced on March 16. The
 program aims at shoring up small businesses and hard-hit sectors 
(hospitality, tourism, retail, commercial complexes, and logistics), 
including through six-month exemptions on utilities payments (water, 
electricity). Logistics areas and small and medium industries are exempt
 from rent payments for six months.</p>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Food and medical goods are exempt from customs duties for six 
months (provided that this is reflected in the selling price), and the 
price and profits for sanitizers and antiseptics have been set. Migrant 
workers who are in quarantine or undergoing treatment will receive full 
salaries.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) has lowered its policy rates twice 
in March in line with the US Federal Reserve (to maintain the currency 
peg). The deposit rate has been reduced by 100bps to 1 percent; the 
lending rate has been reduced by 175 bps to 2.5 percent; and repo rate 
has been reduced by 100 bps to 1.5 percent. The QCB is also providing 
additional liquidity to banks operating in the country through a special
 repo window at zero interest rate for postponing loan installments or 
granting new loans.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Macro-Financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>QCB has put in place mechanisms to encourage banks to postpone 
loan installments and obligations of the private sector with a grace 
period of six months. The Qatar Development Bank is postponing 
installments of all borrowers for six months and is administering the 
National Guarantee Program by allocating QAR 3 billion ($815,000) in 
government guarantees for a period of 12 months to local banks for loans
 to companies to help them meet wage and rental fees; Qatar Islamic Bank
 is providing interest free loans to private companies under this 
program. The Qatar Financial Center has cut the rate on late tax 
payments to zero from 5 percent until September 1, 2020. In addition, 
the deadlines for filing taxes and audited financial statements have 
been extended. Government funds have been directed to increase 
investments in the stock market by QAR 10 billion ($2.75 billion).</p>

<h3>Romania</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first case of COVID-19 was reported 
on February 26, 2020. The government has implemented a range of measures
 to delay the spread of coronavirus and to support people, jobs, and 
businesses. This includes declaring national emergency, increased 
testing, social distancing measures, including the closure of schools 
and entertainment as well as travel and domestic movement restrictions, 
and capping prices of fuel and utilities. GDP contracted by 10.5 percent
 in Q2 of 2020, compared to a year earlier. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The gradual reopening 
started on May 15th. In a first stage, hairdressers, libraries, dentist 
practices, small shops and museums were reopened, and people can leave 
their homes without a sworn statement regarding the purposes of 
traveling. The second round of relaxation measures was implemented on 
June 1st, by lifting restrictions for travel outside cities, resuming 
international vehicle and train transportation, allowing outdoor sports 
competition (without public) and outdoor concerts under special 
conditions, opening terraces and beaches. Starting June 15th, 
international travel to certain countries has been resumed without 
mandatory quarantine/self-isolation upon return, shopping malls (except 
food areas and cinemas), gyms and kindergartens have been opened.  After
 May 15, it is compulsory to wear masks in enclosed spaces in public, 
such as shops and in public transport. Schools remained closed for the 
remainder of the school year, except eight- and twelve-grade students 
who are facing graduation exams. Schools l reopened on September 14th, 
subject to certain conditions. The national alert period which started 
May 15th has been extended to October 16th. Following the increase in 
the number of new cases, new prevention measures became effective August
 1st:, including mandatory wearing of masks in certain open spaces and 
limited hours for outdoor restaurants and clubs. Indoor restaurants and 
bars reopened on September 1st. </p>

    <p>Key tax and spending measures announced so far about 2 percent of
 2019 GDP include (i) additional funds for the healthcare system, (ii) 
covering partially the wages of parents staying home for the period the 
schools are closed, and (iii) measures to support businesses including 
covering in part the wages of self-employed and workers in danger of 
being laid off partially subsidizing the wages of those returning to 
work, deferral of utilities payments for SMEs. In addition, the 
government has provided RON15 billions of guarantees—equivalent to 1.5 
percent of GDP—for loan guarantees and subsidized interest for working 
capital and investment of SMEs. A new guarantee scheme of about RON 1.5 
billion&nbsp; (0.15 percent of GDP ) was adopted to support the 
procurement of work equipment by SMEs. Other measures include faster 
reimbursement of VAT, suspending foreclosures on overdue debtors, 
suspending tax authorities’ control, discounts for paying corporate

<h3>Russian Federation</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong>The first confirmed cases were reported 
on January 31, 2020. The authorities started preemptive containment at 
end-December 2019. They progressively closed the border with China and 
European countries; mandated self-quarantine for people arriving from 
other countries and people at risk; closed schools, theaters, and sports
 facilities; and encouraged remote work. GDP contracted by 8.5 percent 
in Q2 of 2020, compared to a year earlier. On March 30, the authorities 
announced an open-ended quarantine in Moscow requiring non-essential 
businesses to close and people to remain indoors. The central government
 has asked regional authorities to implement containment policies 
commensurate with the extent of infection in their regions. The COVID-19
 shock is compounded by a steep fall in oil prices and the associated 
instability in financial markets. The authorities have adopted an action
 plan to support households and businesses and stand ready to take 
further measures.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The federal government has
 announced a three-stage reopening plan but it is up to regional 
governors to decide when and how to proceed. During the first stage of 
reopening, people will be allowed to walk and exercise outdoors, and 
small shops and service-sector establishments will reopen. The second 
stage will allow schools and larger shops and service-sector businesses 
to open. In the third stage, parks, hotels, restaurants, and all shops 
will reopen. Criteria for lifting restrictions in specific regions 
include infection rates, the availability of hospital beds, and testing 
capacity. As of September 9, 12 regions were in the first stage, 38 in 
the second and 35 in the third, with less than 1.5 percent of regional 
economies (780 thousand people) still under lockdown restrictions.  The 
reopening is conditional on safety guidelines, including social 
distancing and disinfection. Seventy four of 85 regions have reopened 
for domestic tourism.  Russian Railways have resumed 80 percent of 
long-distance trains. Passenger flow at airports increased almost by 2.4
 times m/m in July. Tourist agencies report very sluggish booking of 
tours amid second wave fears. Film theatres reopened in half of the 
regions, but they have restored only 5 percent of their last-year ticket
 sales. Over 30  percent of fitness clubs did not reopen after 
restrictions were lifted. Retail trade rebounded close  to pre-crisis 
levels – with regional variations , - but large shopping malls are 
struggling. The authorities are designing a contingency plan for 
retailers against a potential second wave.  Industrial enterprises and 
construction sites are back in business nationwide. The government has 
prepared a RUB 5 trillion National Economic Recovery Plan to navigate 
the economy through reopening and on to a steady growth path.</p>

salaries at the rate of one minimum salary per employee for two months 
plus subsidized and forgivable loans for all enterprises in affected 
industries to pay minimum wages for 6 months; (xiv) zero import duties 
for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and equipment; (xv) guaranteed 
loans to SMEs and affected industries; (xvi) subsidies to airlines, 
airports, automakers, and others; and (xvii) expanded eligibility for 
subsidized mortgage lending. The total cost of the fiscal package is 
currently estimated at 3.4 percent of GDP.</p>

    <li>
    <p>On July 24, the CBR cut the policy rate by 25 bps to 4.25 
percent. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) started selling FX reserves 
from the National Welfare Fund on March 10, reflecting the fall in oil 
prices below the reference price under the fiscal rule and later for the
 purchase of Sberbank by the government. It also increased the limit on 
its FX swap operations. The CBR has temporarily introduced a long-term 
refinancing instrument (one month and one-year repos).</p>
    <p>The CBR has introduced temporary regulatory easing for banks 
intended to help corporate borrowers, and more favorable treatment for 
FX loans issued to certain sectors. Forbearance as regards provisioning 
for restructured corporate and SME loans will apply to all sectors, not 
only those affected by COVID. The CBR has introduced a new RUB 500bn 
facility for SME lending (in addition to the already allocated 150 
billion rubles to provide loans to SMEs to support and maintain 
employment). Another 50 billion rubles will be allocated for similar 
purposes to borrowers who do not have SME status. From July 27 , the 
interest rate on CBR loans aimed at supporting lending to SMEs, to 
support and maintain employment, will be reduced from 2.5 to 2.25 
percent.</p>
    <p>Banks have been allowed to value securities at their March 1 
prices. FX operations can also be valued at the exchange rate of March 
1, except for those on open forex positions. The Deposit Insurance Fund 
contribution will be reduced from 0.15 percent to 0.1 percent through 
end-2020. Also, the CBR approved measures to ease liquidity regulations 
for systemically important credit institutions. A set of measures was 
taken to protect retail borrowers suffering from the pandemic. 
Parliament approved a law that guarantees the possibility for affected 
citizens and SMEs to receive deferrals of loan payments for up to six 
months. The CBR recommended banks to pursue the same approach to retail 
loan restructuring as stipulated in the law (fast approval or rejection,
 restructuring from the application date, no penalties during the 
consideration period). Banks are allowed not to classify such loans as 
restructured for loss provisioning purposes until December 31, 2020. 
Measures for households include the cancelation of add-ons to risk 
weights for mortgage loans issued before April 1.</p>
    <p>Other support measures to the financial sector included measures 
to ensure the availability of services of non-bank financial 
institutions and to promote remote customer services. Also, measures 
have been taken in the field of AML/CFT and currency control.</p>
    <p>Further regulatory changes to support lending include new credit 
risk assessment methods and lower risk weights in mortgage lending that 
would free about Rub 300 bn (around 0.3 percent of GDP) of banking 
sector capital.  Lower risk weights will be applied to subordinated 
bonds (including perpetual bonds) of largest non-financial corporations –
 the risk coefficient is reduced to 100 percent from 150 percent. To 
stimulate conversion of problem loans of systemic enterprises into 
capital the risk coefficient on such equity will be lowered to 100 
percent from 150 percent. Higher risk coefficients for bank holdings of 
NFC capital are postponed for one year. Lower risk coefficients at70 
percent for loans to medical and pharmaceutical companies is extended 
till end-2020. To promote high-tech exports, the risk coefficient on 
loans to non-commodity exporters guaranteed by EXCAR is reduced to 0 
from 20 percent.</p>
    <p>August 10, the CBR extended some regulatory forbearance beyond 
September 30, through December 31, 2020 and encouraged banks to further 
support affected borrowers. Additionally, the CBR reduced risk buffers 
for unsecured loans to be issued since September 1, 2020, and cancels 
risk buffers for consumer loans issued by August 31, 2019. The CBR 
lifted its cap on banks' fees for online retailers implemented during 
the lockdown.</p>

<h3>Rwanda</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed case was reported on
 March 14, 2020. Rwanda continues to record daily increases in the 
number of COVID-19 infections and is currently experiencing a hike in 
COVID-19 cases.  The government has implemented a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/RwandaHealth?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author" target="_blank">range of containment measures</a>
 in response to the pandemic including border closure, suspension of 
domestic travel, cancellation of public gatherings, institution of 
teleworking, closure of schools, places of worship and non-essential 
businesses, and mandatory wearing of face masks. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> A gradual easing of 
lockdown measures was introduced on May 4, with selected businesses 
allowed to resume operations while adhering to health guidelines. 
Domestic movement restrictions were partially relaxed but strict 
physical distancing measures mandated in public buses. Bars and schools 
remain closed. Steps to reopen the economy include the lifting of 
restrictions on interprovincial travel, with motorcycle taxis permitted 
to resume transportation of passengers except in a few areas under 
lockdown, the reopening of places of worship, and the resumption of 
selected outdoor sports activities and charter flights. Commercial 
flights resumed on August 1, with a requirement for all passengers to 
test negative for COVID-19 within 120h prior to arrival and again upon 
arrival. Travelers leaving Rwanda are also required to take a test. 
Following the recent hike in infections in Kigali, two major markets 
were closed for 14 days, public transportation between the capital and 
other districts prohibited, the nighttime curfew temporarily lengthened,
 and public offices mandated to work at a further reduced capacity to 
reinforce social distancing. A schedule of fines for COVID-19 guidelines
 offenders was also announced. Participants in public gatherings and 
tourists visiting national parks must test negative for COVID-19.  </p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The pandemic is expected to cause a revenue shortfall of 2.8 
percent of GDP. The government’s Economic Recovery Plan in response to 
the pandemic is estimated at about 3.3 percent of GDP. Support to 
vulnerable households takes the form of a food distribution program 
(door-to-door provision of basic food stuffs every three days), cash 
transfers to casual workers, subsidized access to agricultural inputs, 
and measures to ensure poor households’ access to basic health and 
education. The government also launched a fund to support affected 
businesses through subsidized loans from commercial banks and MFIs, and 
credit guarantees. It targets SMEs and hard-hit sectors such as the 
hospitality industry. Tax deferral and relief measures include the 
following: (i) suspension of down payments on outstanding tax for 
amicable settlement, (ii)softening of enforcement for tax arrears 
collection, (iii) extension of the  deadline for filing and paying CIT, 
(iv)  fast-tracking of VAT refunds to SMEs, (v) CIT and PIT payments 
based on current year transactions, (vi) PIT exemption for private 
school teachers and tourism and hotel employees earning less than RWF 
150,000/month, and (vi) VAT exemption for locally produced masks. The 
30-day maturity period for the public health insurance scheme premium 
was removed to expedite access to medical services and the salaries of 
top civil servants for the month of April was redirected to welfare 
programs.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On March 18, the central bank announced liquidity support 
measures: (i) an extended lending facility worth RWF 50 billion (0.5 
percent of GDP) available to liquidity-constrained banks for the next 
six months. Under this facility, banks can borrow at the policy rate and
 benefit from longer maturity periods; (ii) Treasury bond purchases 
through the rediscount window for the next six months; and (iii) 
lowering of the reserve requirement ratio by 100 basis points, from 5 to
 4 percent, effective from April 1. Loan repayment conditions were also 
eased for impacted borrowers, and charges on electronic money 
transactions waived for the next three months. On April 30, the central 
bank cut the policy rate by 50 basis points to 4.5 percent. Charges on 
electronic money transactions were reinstated on June 22.</p>

<h3>Samoa</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> No confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been
 reported in Samoa. The government is taking full precautions and 
preventive measures to control the transmission of COVID-19, including 
preparation of the health system to treat and care for patients. Social 
distancing measures are also in effect. The government declared a State 
of Emergency on March 20 and instructed the public to avoid mass 
gatherings (of five or more people), and unnecessary travel. The amended
 State of Emergency Orders was signed into law on March 26, which gives 
police officers the legal authority to enforce the Emergency Orders to 
the full extent of the law. Samoa implemented travel restrictions to 
protect citizens of the country on January 24, among the first countries
 in the world to do so and has gradually tightened the rules.  </p>
<p>On April 24, the IMF Executive Board approved the disbursement of 
US$22 million in emergency financing under the Rapid Credit Facility 
(RCF) to help Samoa address urgent balance of payments needs created by 
COVID-19. </p>
<p>Press Release: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/04/24/pr20189-samoa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-million-disbursement-address-covid-19-pandemic">https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/04/24/pr20189-samoa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-million-disbursement-address-covid-19-pandemic</a></p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The government issued the 
amendments of the Emergency Orders on May 13 and May 20, to gradually 
lift lockdown restrictions. Currently most businesses are under normal 
operations. Social distancing measures still apply for dining at 
restaurants, and public and village gatherings are permitted only on 
limited occasions. Social gatherings in public places remain closed 
until further notice. On August 27, the government extended the State of
 Emergency Orders until September 27.  Due to the recent Covid-19 
outbreak in Auckland, the government announced on August 26 to 
temporarily halt all international flights (both inbound and outbound). 
The repatriation flights from Australia and New Zealand are scheduled 
for September to bring home the citizens, workers under the seasonal 
employment programs, and scholarship students in the region.  </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government has put together the first phase of the fiscal and
 economic response package, amounting to 66.3 million Samoan tala (about
 3 percent of GDP). The package, approved by parliament on April 7, 
2020, is centered around the mission of “Support the private sector so 
they can feed the nation,” and includes: (i) expenditure to cover the 
immediate medical response; (ii) assistance to the private sector; and 
(iii) assistance to individuals and households. The government has been 
stepping up its efforts to increase the level of preparedness and 
prevention. Temporary quarantine facilities have been established in key
 areas. There is a dire need for testing kits, medical consumables, as 
well as other clinical equipment and medication, to prepare for the 
confirmation/arrival and treatment of COVID-19. The support for the 
private sector includes: a temporary exemption on import duties on most 
commonly bought food items for households; duty concessions to be 
applied to an expanded list of agricultural and fishing materials; a 
grace period of three months to be applied for all loan payments; and a 
six-month moratorium on pension contributions for the hospitality 
sector. Support for citizens includes: establishment of the Emergency 
Price Control Board to keep wholesale and retail prices in check and 
bring them down, if necessary; provision of financial assistance to 
members of the National Provident Fund in the form of a refund of their 
loan payments for March 2020; and a temporary reduction of utility bills
 (both electricity and water) for six months through September 2020.</p>
    <p>On June 30, Parliament approved the FY2021 budget, including the 
second phase of the fiscal and economic response package that amounts to
 83.1 million Samoan tala (about 3.8 percent of GDP). The budget is 
centered around the mission of “Weaving a prosperous and secure future 
for Samoa together,” and includes a similar set of measures as in the 
first stimulus package. It provides a dividend payout by Samoa National 
Provident Fund, a benefit of 50 tala per citizen for a national ID 
registration, a special one-off pension payment, unemployment benefit, 
financial support for utility bills, and paid training for the 
hospitality sector. The health sector continues to be a priority sector 
for the government in light of the COVID19 pandemic, and the package 
finances construction and upgrade of rural hospitals. The government 
will continue to assist remote education services.</p>

CBS will also make sure to maintain ample liquidity in the banking 
system to support businesses and stands ready to activate its lending 
facilities for the financial institutions. The proposed fiscal and 
economic response package includes provision of a three-month grace 
period to be applied for all loan payments. To compensate part of the 
losses in interest income, local commercial banks will receive payments 
from the government.  </p>

<h3>São Tomé and Príncipe</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The first confirmed COVID-19 cases were 
reported on April 6, 2020. The daily new infection has now dropped below
 1. With the help of the WHO, a field hospital was established in 
mid-April, and a lab started to function in mid-June. The state of 
emergency first declared on March 17.  Economic conditions have 
deteriorated since the introduction of confinement measures, and a large
 fiscal need has emerged from an expected drop in revenues and the 
increased spending on health and social services.  </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong>  The government moved from
 a state of emergency to a a state of calamity on June 16, when the 
first of the three phases of reopening started.  The third and last 
phase of the transition began on July 16. The country has reopened 
hotels, restaurants, commercial flights, and extended the operation of 
commerce and public service to normal hours and started in-person 
classes at schools and universities.  </p>

assistance to the most vulnerable, including expansion of the 
WB-supported cash-transfer program, and increased support to the 
disadvantaged (the elderly, disabled and abandoned children); (iii) 
Protecting small businesses and employment, in particular through salary
 contributions; (iv) Financial assistance to workers who lost their jobs
 in both the formal and informal sectors; (v) Implementation of 
automatic stabilizers; (vi) Where supply chains are disrupted, the state
 will procure seeds, feedstock, and other essential inputs to be sold to
 farmers at market price; (vii) Introduction of a solidarity tax on 
workers, including public servants, whose salaries are relatively 
unaffected by the shock.</p>

<h3>Saudi Arabia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Saudi Arabia has been hit by two 
shocks—the spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in oil prices. 
Government policy is responding to both these developments. The first 
confirmed case was reported on March 2, 2020. The authorities have 
implemented a range of measures to limit the spread of the virus 
encompassing curfews; travel restrictions (including on international 
flights and internal public transportation and taxis); suspending 
prayers at mosques; closing all schools, universities, and shopping 
malls; suspending employee attendance at government and private 
workplaces (except for critical staff); and increasing testing. Further,
 early in April, the Ministry of Hajj called on countries to delay their
 bookings for the 2020 Hajj season. Mid-April, the authorities announced
 strict company guidelines including temporary housing accommodation for
 expatriate workers to help control the spread of the virus and on April
 22 a repatriation program called “Auda” (or return) was launched online
 to facilitate the return of expatriates. On May 12, the government 
announced the building of two makeshift hospitals in Makkah to 
accommodate any potential surge in COVID-19 cases. High frequency 
indicators such as the PMI show a sharp slowing of activity in 
March-April and some recovery thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On April 26, the 
authorities ordered a partial lifting of the curfew in all regions, 
except in Makkah and previously isolated neighborhoods. This was 
interrupted by a 5-day nationwide full lockdown and curfew during the 
Eid holidays from May 23 to May 27. On May 26, the authorities announced
 a 3-phase plan for removing coronavirus-related restrictions. During 
the first phase which extended from May 28-30, movement within and 
between all cities (except Makkah) in private cars as well as activities
 in retail and wholesale shops and malls were allowed. During the second
 phase which extended from May 31 to June 20, private sector employees 
were allowed to go back to offices with minimal staff and strict 
observance of coronavirus precautionary measures, domestic flights, 
railways and other public transport were allowed to resume, curfew hours
 were reduced to 8:00pm to 6:00 am in all regions except Makkah, prayers
 in mosques, including Friday prayer, were allowed to resume (except for
 mosques in Makkah), and restaurants and cafes allowed to reopen, 
although the ban on social gatherings of more than 50 people is 
maintained. On June 21, the all clear phase started. Curfew restrictions
 were completely lifted and domestic travel started to return to normal 
throughout the country, while bans on international travel and religious
 pilgrimages were maintained. On June 22, the Saudi authorities 
announced that only a “very limited” number of people who are living in 
the kingdom will be allowed to take part in the 2020 Hajj pilgrimage. On
 July 5, a Royal decree extended the validity of visit visas and expired
 residency, and exit and entry visas for expats for an additional period
 of 3 months free of charge. On July 23, the authorities announced the 
opening of land borders with Kuwait, Bahrain and the UAE so that Saudi 
citizens could enter without a prior authorization. On August 2, one 
thousand pilgrims completed the 2020 Hajj ritual, and on August 4, it 
was announced that travel restrictions on trucks carrying goods from 
neighboring GCC countries were lifted. On August 22, the authorities 
announced that public sector employees will fully resume workplace 
attendance on August 30, while maintaining strict preventive health 
protocols at workplaces. On August 24, land borders reopened to Saudi 
citizens and their non-Saudi family members. On August 30, public sector
 employees returned to work. International travel bans have been 
partially lifted since September 15.  Saudi Arabia will gradually resume
 Umrah pilgrimage starting from October 4 with 30 percent capacity for 
nationals and residents and from November 1 for foreign visitors.</p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal&nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>A SAR 70 billion ($18.7 billion or 2.8 percent of GDP) private sector support package was&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mof.gov.sa/en/MediaCenter/news/Pages/News_20032020.aspx" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;on
 March 20. The package includes the suspension of government tax 
payments, fees, and other dues to provide liquidity to the private 
sector and an increase in available financing through the National 
Development Fund. The government has &nbsp;made budgetary reallocations 
(SAR 47 billion) to increase the resources available to the Ministry of 
Health to fight the virus. The authorities announced spending cuts in 
non-priority areas amounting to SAR 50 billion (2 percent of GDP) to 
accommodate some of these new initiatives within the budget envelope. 
Further, on April 3, the government authorized the use of the 
unemployment insurance fund (SANED) to provide support for wage 
benefits, within certain limits, to private sector companies who retain 
their Saudi staff (SAR 9 billion, 0.4 percent of GDP) and eased 
restrictions on expatriate labor mobility and their contractual 
arrangements. On April 15, additional measures to mitigate the impact on
 the private sector were announced, including temporary electricity 
subsidies to commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors (SAR 0.9 
billion). On May 10, the Ministry of Finance <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mof.gov.sa/en/MediaCenter/news/Pages/News_11052020.aspx" target="_blank">announced</a>
 new fiscal measures to raise more non-oil revenues, rationalize 
spending and maintain the budget envelope. These measures consist of 
additional cuts and delays in capital spending, removal of 
cost-of-living allowances for public sector workers effective June 1, 
and increasing the VAT from 5% to 15% effective July 1. At the end of 
May, the Saudi customs authority announced an increase of custom duties 
for an extensive range of imported goods (around 3000 items), which came
 into effect on June 20. On June 16, The Saudi Industrial Development 
Fund (SIDF) announced initiatives totaling SAR 3.7 billion to support 
536 private sector industrial enterprises impacted by the coronavirus 
pandemic. A new tourism development fund was also announced on June 21. 
On July 1, the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture announced 
it will offer 94 agricultural investment opportunities to the private 
sector in the near term and on July 2, the authorities announced the 
extension of private sector (COVID related) support measures that would 
have expired end-June, including continuing the payment of wage benefits
 to Saudis working in the private sector through SANED, and further 
delaying the payment of some taxes and duties. On July 14, the Ministry 
of Finance launched a SAR 670 million program to help businesses defer 
loan payments  due this year. </p>

    <p>The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) reduced its policy 
rates twice in March, lowering its reverse repo and repo rates by a 
combined 1.25 pp to 0.5 and 1 percent respectively. On March 14, 
SAMA&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.sama.gov.sa/en-US/News/Pages/news-514.aspx" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;a
 SAR 50 billion ($13.3 billion, 2 percent of GDP) package to support the
 private sector, particularly SMEs, by providing funding to banks to 
allow them to defer payments on existing loans and increase lending to 
businesses. The central bank will also cover fees for private sector 
stores and entities for point-of-sale and e-commerce transactions for 3 
months. As of end-June, a total amount of SAR 74.5 billion had been used
 under these programs. SAMA has also instructed banks to delay payments 
of loans extended to all Saudi employees by three months without extra 
fees, to provide financing needed by customers who lose their jobs and 
to exempt customers from various banking fees.
    On June 1st, SAMA <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.sama.gov.sa/en-US/News/Pages/news-574.aspx" target="_blank">announced</a>
 the injection of SAR 50 billion into the banking sector through deposit
 placements to support banking liquidity and private sector credit. On 
September 1, SAMA extended the loan deferred payments program for three 
months until December 14, 2020. </p>

<h3>Senegal</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> A first positive case was reported on 
March 2nd. The daily number of new positive cases has hovered around 100
 since May, with increased testing capacity not translating into much 
higher case counts. As of mid-September, Senegal conducts about 1150 
tests per day (compared with 1000 on average in June-July). The 
government has declared a national state of emergency in March and 
adopted strict containment measures, including suspension of 
international air travel, closure of borders, limits on inter-regional 
travel, bans on public gatherings, school closures, and a curfew. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>The President lifted the 
state of emergency and curfew on June 30. International air travel has 
resumed, while some restrictions such as land border closure remain in 
place.  Containment measures and the sudden stop of travel and tourism 
contribute to a significant economic slowdown, exacerbated by declining 
export demand and lower remittances. The government is preparing a 
National Economic Recovery Program to support the recovery.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government implements a resilience package of up to 7 percent
 of GDP anchored in a revised budget. It consists of four main pillars: 
(i) improving the health system, (ii) strengthening social protection, 
(iii) stabilizing the economy and the financial system to support the 
private sector and employment, and (iv) securing supplies and 
distribution for key foodstuffs, medicine and energy products.  </p>
    <p>
    Health system: The government has allocated FCFA 78,7 billion (0.5 
percent of GDP) to improve testing, treatment, and prevention. It is 
envisaged to hire 1500 additional health workers in the next 18 months, 
especially in rural districts.
    </p>
    Social protection: One million households receive food aid (FCFA 69 
billion) and utility payments for (for water and electricity) for poorer
 customers were suspended for a 2-month period (FCFA 18,5 billion).
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>Stabilizing the economy: Hard-hit sectors such as tourism and 
transport will receive direct support of about FCFA 100 billion and 
access to additional financing through a credit guarantee fund totaling 
FCFA 200 billion. The government will contribute up to FCFA 100 billion 
to this fund. An expedited payment of unmet obligations helps further 
strengthen firms balance sheets (FCFA 200 billion instead of the FCFA 
121 billion foreseen in the initial budget). On the tax side, the 
deadline for paying suspended tax obligations was extended from 12 to 24
 months to improve the liquidity of firms. Their balance sheets will 
also profit from a partial write-off of tax debt. Tax rebates are 
envisaged for companies that keep their workforce and salaries above a 
certain level (estimated cost is FCFA 40 billion).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>
    The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic and 
Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks demand 
for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on 
economic activity. The BCEAO adopted a full allotment strategy at a 
fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum monetary policy rate) thereby 
allowing banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at a rate about 25
 basis points lower than before the crisis. On June 22, the Monetary 
Policy Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the
 monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO 
has also: (i) extended the collateral framework to access central bank 
refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 private 
companies; (ii) set-up a framework inviting banks and microfinance 
institutions to accommodate demands from customers with Covid19-related 
repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period debt 
service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims 
as non-performing; and (iii) introduced measures to promote the use of 
electronic payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched a special 3-month 
refinancing window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for limited amounts of
 3-month "Covid-19 T-Bills" to be issued by each WAEMU sovereign to help
 meet immediate funding needs related to the current pandemic. The 
amount outstanding of such special T-Bills is equivalent to 1.3 percent 
of GDP.  Senegal has been recently allowed to issue the equivalent of 
0.7 percent of GDP of new 3-months Covid-19 T-Bills that may be 
refinanced by the BCEAO for their term to maturity at 2 percent.. 
Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one year the five-year 
period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basel II/III bank 
prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory capital adequacy 
ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 level of 9.5 
percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 2023 instead of 
2022 as initially planned.

<h3>Serbia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Serbia reported its first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on March 6, 2020. The government declared a national state
 of emergency on March 15 and adopted <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.srbija.gov.rs/sekcija/en/151926/covid-19.php" target="_blank">several containment measures</a>.
 These included closing borders, prohibiting movement of citizens during
 the weekends and between 5pm and 5am during weekdays (total ban for 
senior citizens), suspension of public transport and all activities in 
parks and public areas intended for recreation and sports, closing 
education centers and shopping malls (except grocery stores and 
pharmacies). GDP growth reached -0.6 percent in Q1 and -9.2 percent in 
Q2 (s.a. qoq)—+5 percent and -6.4 percent in yoy terms in Q1 and Q2, 
respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Since April 21, 
containment measures were gradually relaxed (with protective measures in
 place), including the reopening of green markets, fitness centers, 
hairdressers, parks, bars, coffee shops, and restaurants; and allowing 
outdoor sports and recreation activities. Inter-city and urban public 
transportation resumed on May 4. On May 7, the state of emergency was 
lifted, abolishing the ban on movement of citizens, including senior 
citizens. Shopping malls reopened on May 8 and kindergartens on May 11 
and commercial flights have resumed since in mid-May. Since May 15, both
 Serbian and foreign citizens are allowed to enter the country 
presenting a negative PCR testing not older than 72 hours (Serbs could 
alternatively stay in quarantine for 14 days). As of May 22, a negative 
test is no longer required to enter Serbia. On May 15, a gradual 
resumption of commercial flights started. As of June 1, outdoor sports 
competitions with public are allowed, with safety measures in place, as 
well as outdoor public gatherings with a maximum of one thousand people.
 As of June 5, there are no more restrictions on the number of people 
allowed in outdoor public gatherings and events. For indoor gathering 
and events, the maximum number of attendees has been increased from 100 
to 500. </p>
<p><strong>New containment measures.</strong> In response to a new wave 
of infections which started in late June, new measures have been 
implemented. On July 1: mandatory use of masks in public transportation 
and indoor spaces and stricter measures in municipalities where 
state-of-emergency is declared. These include limiting the number of 
people in outdoor and indoor gatherings; banning sport and entertainment
 events; limited hours of operation for restaurants and bars; and 
closure of swimming pools, spa and wellness centers. Additional measures
 came into effect on July 17: a nationwide ban on gathering of more than
 10 people in public spaces indoors and outdoors; mandatory distance of 
1.5 meters in public spaces. In light of the declining number of new 
positive cases in August, some of the measures have been relaxed. On 
August 24, cinemas and theater reopened, with safety measures in place 
(max. 500 spectators, mandatory use of masks, etc.).</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>A first package of fiscal measures amounted to about RSD 390bn (7
 percent of GDP). Key measures include: (i) 10 percent wage increase for
 public healthcare sector (RSD 13bn) and increased healthcare spending 
(about RSD 60bn); (ii) one-off payment to all pensioners (RSD 7bn); 
(iii) universal cash transfer of EUR 100 to each citizen over 18 years 
old (about RSD 71bn); (iv) three-month deferment of labor taxes and 
social security contributions for all private companies, to be repaid in
 24 installments starting from 2021 (RSD 100bn); (v) deferment corporate
 income tax advance payment during the second quarter of 2020 (RSD 
21bn); and (vi) wage subsidies, including payment of minimum wages for 
all SME employees and entrepreneurs for three months (RSD 93bn) and 
payment of 50 percent of the net minimum wage for three months for 
employees in large private sector companies and for employees who are 
currently not working (RSD 4bn). Other measures include a 3-month 
moratorium on enforcement and interests on tax debt under rescheduling 
agreements and 10 percentage points reduction of the interest rate on 
tax debt. A state guarantee scheme for bank loans to SMEs has been 
approved (RSD 240bn), as well new loans to SMEs from the Development 
Fund (RSD 24bn).</p>
    <p>A second round of measures was adopted in late July, including 
wage subsidies for SME employees for another two months (RSD 36 
billion), and deferment of labor taxes and social security contributions
 for all private companies for an additional month (RSD 30 billion).
    </p>
    <p>In late August, the authorities announced one-off fiscal support 
to help hotels in cities, through a fixed subsidy per room and per bed, 
with a cost of about 0.02 percent of GDP.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On March 12, the <a target="_blank" href="https://nbs.rs/internet/english/scripts/showContent.html?id=15301&amp;konverzija=no">National Bank of Serbia (NBS) cut the key policy rate from 2.25 percent to 1.75 percent</a> and narrowed the interest rate corridor from ±1.25pp to ±1pp relative to the key policy rate. On April 9, <a target="_blank" href="https://nbs.rs/internet/english/scripts/showContent.html?id=15392&amp;konverzija=no">the NBS cut the policy rate from 1.75 percent to 1.5 percent</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://nbs.rs/internet/english/scripts/showContent.html?id=15572&amp;konverzija=no">On June 11, it cut the policy rate again to 1.25 percent</a>.
 It has also provided liquidity (both in dinars and euros) to banks 
through additional EUR/RSD swap auctions and repo purchase auctions and 
outright purchases of dinar government securities, and reduced the FX 
swap interest rates (NBS deposit facility rate plus 10 bp for dinars and
 0 percent for euros). Moreover, the NBS introduced a <a target="_blank" href="https://nbs.rs/internet/english/15/mediji/vesti/20200319.html">3-months moratorium</a>
 on all repayments under bank loans and financial leasing agreements. In
 May, local-currency denominated corporate bonds became eligible for 
open market operations (OMOs) and as collateral for banks to receive 
daily liquidity loans and short-term liquidity from the NBS. On June 11,
 the NBS relaxed the loan-to-value (LTV) cap for first-home buyers 
mortgage loans, increasing the limit from 80% to 90%.</p>
    <p>In July, the NBS set up a repo line arrangement with the ECB to 
address possible euro liquidity needs of Serbian financial institutions.
 Under this repo line, the ECB provides euro liquidity (up to EUR 1 
billion) to the NBS in exchange for adequate euro-denominated 
collateral. Moreover, a new 2-month moratorium was introduced, relieving
 debtors of repaying their liabilities during August and September. 
&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In August, the NBS adopted a new set of temporary measures 
through 2021 intended to provide easier access to housing loans for 
individuals. These measures include the earlier approval of mortgages 
before construction is completed, the possibility of extending mortgage 
repayment periods, and a temporary relaxation of the approval procedure 
for short-term dinar loans up to a certain amount.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>

    <p>The NBS has intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market to 
maintain a relatively stable exchange rate during the crisis period.</p>

<h3>Seychelles</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Seychelles has successfully avoided 
outbreak of COVID-19 inside the country. While 139 total cases have been
 reported, 136 cases have fully recovered and there are no deaths. The 
government has adopted containment measures, including social 
distancing, travel bans on visitors from high-risk regions, screening at
 ports of entry, and school closures. Given that about 30 percent of the
 GDP directly or indirectly relates to tourism sector, the disruption to
 global tourism can have an adverse impact on the economy. Inflation has
 been contained so far as lower oil prices offset the impact of a 
depreciating rupee and supply side disruptions.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Mandatory work-from-home 
was lifted on April 30. On May 18, all schools were reopened. On June 1,
 the country reopened its border to passenger flights, limited to 
chartered flights only from low-risk countries. Some commercial flights 
from low-risk and medium risk countries have been allowed to enter the 
country starting on August 1.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government has announced a measure to subsidize wages for 
companies facing distress caused by COVID-19, whose fiscal cost is 
estimated up to about 5 percent of 2020 GDP. A revised 2020 budge was 
approved by the National Assembly in late April. From July, Seychelles 
Employee Transition Scheme (SETS) was set up to facilitate the 
reskilling and placement in an economic activity of persons made 
redundant as a result of economic decline following the COVID-19 
pandemic. It is an emergency support mechanism put in place by the 
government to work alongside the Financial Assistance for Job Retention 
(FA4JR) already in place.</p>
    <p>In early September, additional measures were introduced to 
support households and firms: Clients of the Home Finance Company (HFC) 
and the Property Management Corporation (PMC) will benefit from a 25 
percent support on their loan repayments between Sep 1, 2020 and Dec 31,
 2021; from Sep 10, Small Business Support Fund (SBSF) facility was 
launched, which will provide interest-free loans to small businesses. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) reduced the policy rate by 
100 bps to 4 percent on March 23. On the same day, it announced that a 
credit facility of approximately SCR500 million would be set up to 
assist commercial banks with emergency relief measures to support 
businesses and individuals struggling with the financial impact of the 
pandemic. The CBS also announced that commercial banks, the Development 
Bank of Seychelles (DBS) and the Seychelles Credit Union have agreed to 
consider a moratorium of up to six months on the repayment of principal 
and interest on loans to assist businesses in impacted sectors. The 
moratorium for individuals is up to three months. In early September, 
the banking community has agreed to continue offering and prolonging the
 measures announced in March to assist their individual as well as 
business customers who have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>The National Assembly has allowed the Central Bank to provide (i)
 a limited credit to government up to SCR 500 million, preferably 
through purchase of securities, and subject to central bank Board 
approval; and (ii) extending the maturity of credit to commercial banks 
to 3 years. In May, a credit facility of SCR500 million was established 
to assist commercial banks with emergency relief measures to support 
small- and medium-sized enterprises and another credit facility of 
SCR750 million to support large enterprises was established. The CBS 
will continue to monitor potential market stress and any emerging risks 
to the financial sector and the economy. The CBS cut the policy rate by 
100 bps again to 3 percent, effective of July 1. It also lowered the 
Minimum Reserve Requirement (MRR) on Rupee deposits from 13% to 10%.</p>

<h3>Sierra Leone</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Since the first COVID-19 case in late 
March, the cumulative number of cases has climbed steadily (above 2000 
by early September). The Government is partnering with the WHO to 
increase testing capacity, which remains constrained. At the onset of 
the pandemic, the Government acted decisively to implement prevention 
measures, including the President declaring on March 24 a 12 month 
national state of emergency. Since late June, the Government has been 
progressively easing restrictions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
    <li><strong><em>Border controls and closure. </em></strong>Mandatory
 quarantine on entering the country and closure of land borders. A 
3-month suspension of passenger flights has been in place since March; 
Lungi International Airport will re-open on July 22.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Social distancing. </em></strong>Closed education 
institutions on March 31; schools reopened for six weeks starting July 1
 for exams and reopened normally in September. Discourage gatherings of 
more than 100 people; restrict use of public beaches; shorten opening 
hours for entertainment industry; limit number of passengers on public 
transport; require face masks in public. In Freetown, a special bus 
service transports health workers to/from work. Places of worship were 
allowed to re-open on July 13.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Lockdown.</em></strong> The partial lockdown—in 
place since April—restricted non-essential inter-district travel, 
reduced public working hours (9am to 4pm); and imposed a national 
evening curfew (9pm to 7am). The country also implemented two full 
lockdowns (April 5 7 and then May 3–5) during which all were required to
 stay home. The Government lifted restrictions on inter-district travel 
on June 23 and has since also shortened the curfew (now 11pm to 5am).</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of Late September, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government’s fiscal response focuses on addressing 
containment needs, critical health needs, and the socio-economic impact 
of the crisis. The Health Response Plan is being formulated in 
collaboration with development partners, including the World Bank via a 
$7.5 million health system support operation approved in early April. On
 April 22, the government announced plans to introduce incentives for 
healthcare workers, including a risk allowance, as well as plans to 
recruit 4,000 additional health workers. The authorities’ Quick Action 
Economic Response Program (QAERP) seeks to mitigate the broader socio 
economic impact by: ensuring a stable supply of essential commodities 
and food; providing support to small and medium enterprises; and scaling
 up social protection and public works for the most vulnerable. The IMF 
disbursed $143 million in emergency assistance in early June and the 
World Bank’s budget support of $101.6 million was disbursed in mid-July.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The central bank held an emergency Monetary Policy Committee 
meeting on March 18. They decided to: (i) reduce the monetary policy 
rate (mostly signaling) by 150 bps from 16.5 percent to 15 percent, 
effective March 19; (ii) create a special credit facility (Le 500 
billion) to support production, procurement and distribution of 
essential goods; and (iii) extend the reserve requirement maintenance 
period from 14 to 28 days to ease tight liquidity. Rates were held 
constant at the most recent MPC meeting in July.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Following the March 18 MPC meeting, the central bank announced 
its intention to provide FX resources to ensure the importation of 
essential goods. The exchange rate has been allowed to adjust.</p>

<h3>Singapore</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The first confirmed COVID-19 case in 
Singapore was reported on January 23, 2020. Safe distancing measures 
were considerably intensified in April to break the trend of increasing 
local transmission. In view of a significant decrease in community 
transmissions, the Government announced <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gov.sg/article/ending-circuit-breaker-phased-approach-to-resuming-activities-safely" target="_blank">a three-phased approach</a>
 to resume activities starting June 2. Community infection rates have 
remained generally stable and Phase Two commenced on June 19. Real GDP 
contracted by 13.2 percent in 2020Q2 and 0.3 percent in 2020Q1 on an 
annual basis.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The authorities have announced several packages of fiscal support
 measures (February 18, March 26, April 6, April 21, May 26, August 17) 
amounting to about S$100 billion. Support to households includes a cash 
payout to all Singaporeans (higher for families with children under 20),
 and additional payments for lower-income individuals and the 
unemployed. Support to businesses includes wage subsidies (extended 
through March 2021, with levels of support depending on the sector), 
support to cover rental costs, an enhancement of financing schemes, and 
additional support for the self-employed and industries most directly 
affected (aviation, tourism, construction, transportation, arts and 
culture). The authorities have increased their contingencies funds for 
unforeseen expenditure needs and also set aside loan capital of S$20 
billion to help businesses and individuals facing cash flow challenges 
with loan obligations and insurance premium payments. Other economic 
resilience measures include support to R&amp;D investment, a national 
stockpile of health supplies, and a program on food resilience.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On February 14, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) 
welcomed the announcements from banks and insurers in Singapore to 
support their customers facing financial difficulties due to the impact 
of the COVID-19 outbreak, while adhering to prudent risk assessments. On
 March 31, the MAS and the financial industry announced a detailed 
package of measures to help individuals and SMEs facing temporary 
cashflow difficulties.&nbsp;The package has three components: (i) help 
individuals meet their loan and insurance commitments; (ii) support SMEs
 with continued access to bank credit and insurance cover; and (iii) 
ensure interbank funding markets remain liquid and well-functioning. A 
second package announced on April 30 extends the scope of relief for 
individuals to a broader set of loan commitments.</p>
    <p>On March 19, the MAS announced the establishment of a US$60 
billion swap facility with the US Federal Reserve. The MAS is drawing on
 this facility to provide USD liquidity to Singapore banks through 
weekly auctions held every Monday since late March. On July 30, MAS 
announced that the swap facility has been extended to end-March 2021. </p>
    <p>On March 30, the MAS adopted a zero percent annual rate of 
appreciation of the policy band and reduced the mid-point to the 
prevailing level of the S$NEER, with no change to the width of the band.</p>
    <p>On April 7 the MAS announced that it will adjust selected 
regulatory requirements and supervisory programs to enable financial 
institutions to better deal with issues related to the pandemic.</p>
    <p>On April 8, 2020, the MAS announced a S$125 million support 
package to sustain and strengthen financial services and FinTech 
capabilities. The package, funded by the Financial Sector Development 
Fund, has three main pillars: (i) supporting workforce training and 
manpower costs; (ii) strengthening digitalization and operational 
resilience; and (iii) enhancing FinTech firms’ access to digital tools.</p>
    <p>On July 29, the MAS called on locally-incorporated banks 
headquartered in Singapore to cap their total dividends per share to 60 
percent of the FY2019 level and offer shareholders the option to receive
 dividends in scrip (as shares) instead of cash. On Aug 7 MAS urged 
Finance companies incorporated in Singapore to also cap their total 
dividends per share for FY2020 at 60 percent of FY2019’s level.  </p>
    <p>On September 3, the MAS announced measures to enhance the banking
 system’s access to Singapore dollar (SGD) and US dollar (USD) funding 
effective September 28. A new MAS SGD term facility will offer SGD funds
 in the 1-month and 3-month tenors, complementing the existing overnight
 MAS Standing Facility. A wider range of collateral comprising cash and 
marketable securities in SGD and major currencies will be accepted. 
Domestic systemically important banks that are incorporated in Singapore
 will be able to also pledge eligible residential property loans as 
collateral at the term facility. Pricing will be set above prevailing 
market rates, in line with the facility’s objective to serve as a 
liquidity backstop. MAS will also expand the range of collateral that 
banks in Singapore can use to access USD liquidity from the MAS USD 
facility, in line with what is accepted at the new SGD term facility.</p>

<h3>The Kingdom of the Netherlands—Sint Maarten</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> As of September 24, Sint Maarten has 78 
active cases. From the beginning of the pandemic, the authorities 
reported 616 positive cases and 21 deaths. The authorities began 
implementing the measures and travel restrictions to control the spread 
of COVID-19 on March 6. Nevertheless, the first case was diagnosed on 
March 17. On March 22, the borders were closed for all passenger 
traffic. On March 30, a night curfew was implemented and the border 
between Sint Maarten and Saint Martin closed and jointly patrolled with 
the French government. As the number of cases grew, the authorities 
declared a State of Emergency and a full lockdown on April 5. A phased 
reopening of the local businesses started on May 10 and the border 
between Sint Maarten and Saint Martin was re-opened on September 18 
after almost two months of closure to slow down the spread of the virus.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The government lifted the 
state of emergency and allowed all businesses to reopen. The authorities
 began their phased reopening to international travel. The first and the
 second phases (June 15 and 22) allowed travel from several Caribbean 
countries (Anguilla, Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Guadeloupe, Martinique, 
Saba, St. Barthelemy, St. Eustatius) assessed as posing a low risk of 
COVID-19 transmission—visitors from these countries are not required to 
take a COVID-19 test. The third phase (July 1) allowed travel from 
additional Caribbean countries, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany,
 Italy and the Netherlands, assessed as posing a medium risk of 
transmission. The fourth phase (August 1) allowed travel from high-risk 
countries, including the United States. An electronic Health 
Authorization application must be filled by every visitor whether 
arriving by air, boat or in transit. Without the health authorization, 
entry into the country will be denied. Travelers originating from 
moderate or high-risk countries in the 14 days prior to coming to St. 
Maarten are requested to have a COVID-19 PCR test performed within 72 
hours prior to departure to St. Maarten.  Travelers from high-risk 
countries are also required to self-monitor their body temperature and 
possible flu-like symptoms for 14 consecutive days while those coming 
from a moderate risk country are only required to self-monitor for 8 
days. Travelers coming to Sint Maarten from a low-risk country such as 
Anguilla, Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saba, St. 
Barths, St. Martin and St. Eustatius will be exempted from the mandatory
 PCR test. </p>

<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On April 19, the authorities published the Sint Maarten Stimulus 
and Relief Plan (SSRP) that elaborated fiscal measures for the second 
quarter of 2020. The direct relief measures included (i) a payroll 
support program (covering up to 80 percent of the payroll of qualifying 
businesses, (ii) income support for sole proprietors, vendor license 
holders, bus and independent taxi drivers (up to NAf 1,150 per person 
per month); (iii) job loss benefits (NAf 1,150 per person per month), 
and (iv) soft loans to SMEs (NAf 33 million). The SSRP also envisaged 
additional spending in the health sector (NAf 56.4 million) comprising 
additional healthcare expenses, liquidity support for the social 
security fund and the hospital. Finally, it included a food voucher 
program and a food box program for the most vulnerable groups, meals for
 the elderly and psycho-social care (NAf 9.3 million in total). In order
 to cover the loss of fiscal revenue and the fiscal support measures in 
the second quarter of 2020, Sint Maarten requested financing in amount 
of NAf 258 million from the Netherlands. The Netherlands provided NAf 
114 million (6½ percent of GDP) for the second quarter. Given available 
financing, measures implemented in the second quarter included the 
payroll subsidy, income support for sole proprietors, job loss benefits 
and the food vouchers. Financing for the third quarter is under 
negotiation. The total size of support in 2020 will depend on available 
financing.</p>

    <p>On March 20, 2020, the Centrale Bank van Curaçao en Sint Maarten 
(CBCS) reduced the pledging rate--at which the commercial banks can 
borrow from the CBCS--by 150 basis points to 1 percent and suspended the
 200 basis points surcharge on the pledging rate on loans exceeding NAf 
20 million. Furthermore, the CBCS reintroduced the overdraft facility 
for commercial banks. The CBCS also announced that it would lower the 
interest rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) to ease the money market
 by absorbing less liquidity.</p>
    <p>On March 20, 2020, the CBCS (i) allowed commercial banks and 
credit institutions to provide a 3 to 6-month payment moratorium on 
interest and principal of all outstanding loans, without having to make 
an adequate provision, (ii) announced that commercial banks might exceed
 the debt service ratio (37 percent), to a maximum of 50 percent, and 
(iii) allowed life insurance companies and pension funds to provide 
clients a 3 to 6-month payment moratorium on policy premiums without 
having to make an adequate provision.</p>

<h3>Slovak Republic</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The fist confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 6, 2020. The government implemented a range of 
measures to delay the spread of COVID-19 since March 13, including 
social distancing, closing schools and entertainment and hospitality 
premises, limiting international travel, and promoting the widespread 
use of face masks. GDP declined by 5.2 percent q/q in 2020Q1 (3.7 
percent y/y), and by 8.3 percent q/q in Q2 (12.1 percent y/y).</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>The Slovak Republic 
started to gradually ease containment measures on April 22. The limited 
number of new cases allowed for a subsequent acceleration of reopening 
plans, with the national emergency ending on June 13 and most 
containment measures now lifted. International travel has also been 
relaxed: the main Slovak airports resumed flights in mid-June, and the 
compulsory two-week quarantine for Slovaks arriving from more than 30 
countries has been lifted. Due to a recent rise in new Covid-19 cases, 
some targeted containment measures were reintroduced. For example, mass 
events over 1,000 people and indoor events with more than 500 people, 
which were allowed from June 10, were forbidden for a month in 
September. The authorities also strengthened the containment measures 
for people coming from high-risk countries. </p>

    <p>Measures introduced by the new coalition government include (i) 
wage compensation for affected businesses and self-employed, and 
subsidies to individuals without income; (ii) enhanced unemployment 
benefits, and sickness and nursing benefits; (iii) deferral and waiver 
of employers' health insurance and social security contributions for 
affected companies and self-employed; (iv) easing of the administrative 
burden on businesses and relaxing labor code requirements; (v) deferral 
of payroll and corporate tax payments for businesses whose revenues 
decline by more than 40 percent; (vi) allowing companies to include loss
 carryback since 2014; (vii) rental subsidies; and (viii) higher medical
 spending. These measures (the wage compensation program is extended to 
end-year) are estimated to amount to EUR 2.2 billion (including reserves
 for a possible second wave of Covid-19), or 2.3 percent of 2019 GDP. To
 ease liquidity pressures, the government introduced several state 
guarantee schemes, up to a total of EUR 4 billion, covering both SMEs 
and large firms. Individuals, self-employed and SMEs are also allowed to
 defer loan repayments for up to 9 months, while a rent payment 
moratorium was imposed until June 30.</p>

    The National bank of Slovakia (NBS) has implemented the following 
measures as part of a coordinated approach with the ECB and the European
 Banking Authority (EBA): i) banks may partially meet Pillar 2 
requirements using capital instruments that do not qualify as common 
equity tier 1 (CET1) capital; ii) banks may, in duly justified cases, 
temporarily operate below the level of capital defined by the capital 
conservation buffer; iii) banks will also, where justified, be 
temporarily exempted from full compliance with the LCR. The NBS decided 
to reduce the CCyB rate from 1.5 to 1.0 percent as of Aug 1, 2020, 
repealing its previous decision to increase the rate to 2.0 percent. The
 NBS also lowered the capital buffer for systemically important

<h3>Republic of Slovenia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly 
affected Slovenia, a small country with a population of 2.08 million. 
Since the first confirmed COVID-19 case on March 4, there have been 
nearly   4,694 confirmed cases and 143 deaths. While new infections 
remained subdued in May, Slovenia is experiencing a lesser surge in new 
infections from end-June, mainly on the back of higher number of tests. 
Real GDP grew by 2.4 percent in 2019 but contracted year-on year by 2.5 
percent (seasonally adjusted) in 2020:Q1. Flash estimates show further 
contraction of real GDP by 13 percent (seasonally adjusted) in 2020:Q2. 
The authorities projected the 2020 growth at about -8 percent (Stability
 Program 2020). Since March, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gov.si/en/topics/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/" target="_blank">the authorities have implemented a range of measures</a>
 to delay the spread of coronavirus and cushion the adverse impact on 
people and businesses. These include border checks, increased testing, 
shutting down schools, public transit, restaurants and non-essential 
stores, and providing economic stimulus.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> With progress in 
containing the infections and conducing random tests to monitor 
infections, the government started the gradual reopening with safety 
rules from April. This began with limited city-to city travel and some 
public transit for businesses in mid-April. The easing of the 
restrictions then broadened to some services, which were in May expanded
 to fully reopen in-city public transportation, schools, and some sport 
activities. In the process, the authorities issued detailed guidelines 
on protective measures. On May 15, Slovenia became the first EU country 
to declare the end of the Covid-19 epidemic in the country, although 
some anti-COVID-19 restrictions remained in place. As of August 6, 
citizens of 25 EU and non-EU countries may enter Slovenia without 
restrictions nor mandatory quarantine, from an earlier list of 17 
countries in early June. Given a surge in new infections in late June, 
the authorities tightened containment measures, including the mandatory 
use of masks, limits on large gatherings from 50 participants, setting 
rules for kindergartens, and using a contact tracking app.</p>

    <p>As part of an economic stimulus package of € 1 billion (2.2 
percent of GDP) announced on March 9, the authorities have adopted some 
tax and spending measures, including (i) <strong>tax deferrals</strong> for up to 24 months or tax payments in installments in 24 months; (ii) <strong>wage subsidies</strong> for suspended workers due to pandemic-related closures and quarantined people (about €50 million). (iii) <strong>Other support to household</strong>
 income included providing a monthly basic income, support to 
self-employed; one-off support to pensioners and students, and subsidies
 to kindergarten and large families. (iv) <strong>Support to corporate liquidity</strong>
 was provided through grants, equity purchase, and government guarantees
 and credit lines open to the affected businesses, particularly SMEs 
(€600 million). In addition, corporate income tax and social security 
contributions could be deferred. Lastly, the administered price for 
electricity was cut by a third to ease the burden of the pandemic 
crisis. An approved emergency bill also granted the government more 
discretion in using budget funds, including for health spending. On 
April 2, Parliament approved a new economic stimulus package of € 3 
billion (6.7 percent GDP) that also consolidated some earlier measures. 
Measures include selective tax exemptions and co-financing of social 
contributions, increased wage subsidies, temporary income support for 
vulnerable groups, health worker bonuses, as well as credit lines and 
loan guarantees. On April 28, the Parliament adopted another stimulus 
package of € 2 billion (4.5 percent of GDP), which focused on providing 
guarantees to businesses and included amendments to the previous package
 to relax the conditions and expand to more beneficiaries. On May 29, 
Parliament adopted the third package of about € 1 billion to support 
economic recovery, including subsidies for shortened work time, vouchers
 for tourism, and liquidity loans. Accordingly, in early June, each 
adult in Slovenia received a € 200 voucher (€ 50 per child) to be spent 
in accommodation in Slovenia, as a measure to support tourism. The 
amount earmarked is € 345 million and can be used until end-2020.On June
 28, the government adopted an emergency bill to address the surge in 
new cases, including an extension of the furlough support scheme until 
end-September and a legal basis for the tracking app. </p>

liquidity problems attributed to the Covid-19 epidemic. At end-July, 
banks had received about 23,000 applications with an aggregate deferred 
amount reaching about € 330 million. The authorities also created a 
public guarantee amounting to € 2.2 billion to cover loans extended to 
non-banking corporations to facilitate access to lending, with first 
publicly guaranteed loans from mid-July.  </p>

preventative measures implemented by the government include suspension 
of all commercial international flights, temporary ban on entry of 
non-citizens, and strict mandatory quarantine for all returning 
passengers. In addition, the government has declared a state of 
emergency until November, temporarily scaling down public services to 
essential services only, closing schools and suspending some services as
 well as restricting domestic travel.</p>
<p>On June 1, the IMF Executive Board approved the disbursement of

<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.&nbsp;</strong>On April 24, the 
Prime Minister confirmed that COVID-19 tests can be done in country 
after the arrival of medical testing equipment funded by its donor 
partners. On May 8, the Prime Minister made the order to reopen business
 entities except for night clubs within the emergency zone, Honiara (the
 capital). On May 20, the emergency zones, including Honiara, went into a
 mock lockdown for 36 hours to test their capabilities in case of future
 needs. By May 25, all schools had reopened. After confirming its 
in-country COVID-19 testing capability, the government began 
repatriation of its stranded nationals from Australia, New Zealand, 
&nbsp;China and other Pacific Island Countries from May onwards. The 
government has also begun to allow the entry of foreign technical staff 
to work on donor-funded projects, including for Pacific Games 2023. 
Quarantine facilities have been established within close proximity to 
the Honiara International Airport and in the western province of Gizo 
that shares borders with PNG. The national airline, Solomon Airlines, 
announced on July 29, the suspension of all international flights has 
been extended until October 24 but it will continue to operate 
government approved cargo and charter flights as needed. On August 28, 
the national airline laid off 20 percent of its workforce.</p>

    <li>
    <p>COVID-19 has had a significant negative impact on government 
finances, as a result of additional COVID-19 related spending pressures 
and lower revenue trends over the last four months. The government has 
adopted a COVID-19 economic stimulus package of SI$319 million (about 
2.6 percent of GDP), to be financed by both government and donors. The 
package aims to provide social assistance to vulnerable households and 
firms, as well as supporting economic recovery. These includes ongoing 
payroll support for non-essential public servants; employment support 
for youth and women; subsidies for copra and cocoa; capital grants to 
businesses to support investment in productive and resource sectors; tax
 and utility relief for affected businesses in specific sectors; equity 
injection to government owned companies; and advancing planned 
infrastructure investment. On June 8, the new Development Bank of 
Solomon Islands (DBSI) was officially launched. On June 15, the cabinet 
revoked the decision on half-pay for non-essential public servants that 
started on March 31. Any salary that was withheld will be repaid when 
officers are recalled to duty. The fiscal response triggered a 
supplemental 2020 budget appropriation bill, which has been approved by 
parliament on September 3. </p>
    <p>On April 25, the government issued its first covid-19 domestic 
development bond of SI$120 million to finance its COVID-19 economic 
stimulus package. The government has also reallocated SI$156 million in 
previously budgeted spending to fund the COVID-19 preparedness and 
response plan. Two state owned enterprises (Solomon Islands Ports 
Authority and Solomon Islands Electricity Authority) have provided 
dividend payments to support the government’s COVID-19 preparedness and 
response plan. The government is receiving funds and medical supplies 
from several countries, including Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, 
the United States, and development partners (including the World Bank 
and the Asian Development Bank) to support its COVID-19 response. In 
addition to the disbursement under the RCF/RFI, the IMF has provided 
debt service relief through its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust
 (CCRT). </p>

<h3>Somalia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Somalia recorded its first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on March 16, 2020. In early March, the authorities 
established a COVID-19 response coordination committee led by the Prime 
Minister and, in coordination with the WHO and the UN, the Ministry of 
Health has taken  measures to contain the spread of the outbreak and to 
strengthen health systems, including restricting large meetings and 
gatherings; closing schools and universities; closing borders suspending
 international and domestic flights; and intensifying communication 
through various channels including radio, TV and social media. As of 
April 15, they imposed an evening curfew. As Somalia faced the COVID-19 
health crisis, the authorities and international health experts 
recognized that, given the country’s very weak health infrastructure and
 large vulnerable population, including internally displaced, Somalia 
would be ill-prepared to cope with any significant outbreak. In 
response, Somalia’s partners and the Ministry of Health have launched a 
Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP) to address the immediate 
humanitarian and socio-economic consequences. These joint efforts focus 
on averting large-scale community spread through risk communication; 
testing; contact tracing; distribution of PPE to health workers; 
undertaking measures to mitigate risks to Internally Displaced 
Populations, refugees, asylum seekers and host communities; and 
minimizing risks in detention places. As a result, recent data appear to
 suggest that daily rate of infection is slowing.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>The Somali authorities 
have started a phased approach to reopening the economy. Domestic and 
international flights have resumed on July 5 and August 3, respectively,
 and public schools are scheduled to start reopening as of August 15.  </p>

 basic goods  by 50 percent and lifted restrictions on imports of rice 
from Vietnam. In late June, Cabinet approved a revised 2020 supplemental
 budget that reflects substantial donor support and  allows for

<h3>South Africa</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> South Africa reported its first 
confirmed COVID-19 case on March 5, 2020. The government has declared a 
national state of disaster and adopted containment measures, including 
social distancing, travel bans on visitors from high-risk countries and 
quarantine for nationals returning from those countries, screening at 
ports of entry, school closures, screening visits to homes, and 
introduction of mobile technology to track and trace contacts of those 
infected and inform individuals if they have been in close proximity to a
 person diagnosed with Covid-19. A nationwide lockdown was put in place 
from midnight March 26, with only critical workers and transport 
services, the banking sector, essential food and medicine production, 
and retail, operating. On April 27, a delegation of 217 infectious 
disease experts arrived at the request of the government to support its 
health response to Covid-19. On May 1, 2020, a phased lifting of the 
lockdown began, allowing a few sectors to resume operation and others 
only partially. On May 13, a further relaxation of the lockdown was 
announced effective June 1. On May 24, it was specified that the June 1 
relaxation would be broader than previously announced. Most economic 
activities reopened under strict health and social distancing practices 
except for high risk ones (i.e., restaurants, bars, taverns, 
accommodation, domestic air travel, conferences, events, entertainment, 
sporting activities, and personal services). The sale of alcohol was 
allowed on a restricted basis while the sale of tobacco remained banned.
 Remote work has always been encouraged where possible. Starting June 8,
 schools started to reopen and on June 17, restrictions on sit-down 
restaurants, hotels, conference centers, casinos, non-contact sports, 
and personal care services were relaxed under strict adherence to health
 protocols. On July 12, in response to a growing number of Covid-19 
cases, a curfew and an alcohol ban were reintroduced and the wearing of 
facemasks in public was made mandatory. The national state of disaster 
was extended to August 15. On July 23, it was announced that, starting 
on July 27, public schools would be closed for one month with minor 
exceptions. On August 15, the national state of disaster was extended to
 September 15 and on September 11 extended once again to October 31. On 
August 17, following a drop in the number of daily cases, the sale of 
alcohol was allowed to resume subject to certain restrictions while 
restrictions on inter-provincial travel and the operation of 
accommodation, hospitality venues, beaches, restaurants, bars, and 
taverns were relaxed subject to strict adherence to health protocols and
 social distancing. On September 21, following a flattening of the 
Covid-case curve, an additional relaxation of restrictions was 
announced, lifting almost all restrictions including international 
travel to certain countries from October 1. Net capital outflows (bonds 
and equities) since the beginning of the pandemic have amounted to $10.1
 billion (3.6 percent of GDP); the sovereign’s dollar credit spread has 
increased more than 50 percent to 312.4 bps; and the rand has 
depreciated by about 15 percent vis-à-vis the US dollar. Following a 
request from the government, on July 27 the IMF approved emergency 
assistance under the Rapid Financing Instrument equivalent to US$4.3 
billion.</p>

 through the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) and special programs from
 the Industrial Development Corporation. Additional funds are available 
for the health response to Covid-19, workers with an income below a 
certain threshold are receiving a small tax subsidy for four months, and
 the most vulnerable families are receiving temporarily higher social 
grant amounts for six months. A new 6-month Covid-19 grant was also 
created to cover unemployed workers that do not receive grants or UIF 
benefits and the numbers of food parcels for distribution was increased.
 Funds are available to assist SMEs under stress, mainly in the tourism 
and hospitality sectors, and small-scale farmers operating in the 
poultry, livestock, and vegetables sectors. A new loan guarantee scheme 
is helping companies with turnover below a certain threshold to get bank
 financing for the payment of operating expenses as of May 12. 
Allocations are also being made to a solidarity fund to help combat the 
spread of the virus, with assistance of private contributions, and 
support municipal provision of emergency water supply, increased 
sanitation in public transport, and food and shelter for the homeless. 
The revenue administration is accelerating reimbursements and tax 
credits, allowing SMEs to defer certain tax liabilities, and has issued a
 list of essential goods for a full rebate of customs duty and import 
VAT exemption. A 4-month skills development levy tax holiday is also

 100 bps to 4.25 percent on April 14, 50 bps to 3.75 percent on May 21, 
and 25 bps to 3.5 percent on July 23. On March 20, it announced measures
 to ease liquidity conditions by: (i) increasing the number of repo 
auctions to two to provide intraday liquidity support to clearing banks 
at the policy rate; (ii) reducing the upper and lower limits of the 
standing facility to lend at repo-rate and borrow at repo-rate less 200 
bps; and (iii) raising the size of the main weekly refinancing 
operations as needed. On March 23, the government announced the launch 
of a unified approach to enable banks to provide debt relief to 
borrowers. On March 25, the SARB announced further measures to ease 
liquidity strains observed in funding markets. The program aims to 
purchase government securities in the secondary market across the entire
 yield curve and extend the main refinancing instrument maturities from 3
 to 12 months. On March 26, the SARB issued guidelines on modalities to

temporary relief on bank capital requirements and reduced the liquidity 
coverage ratio from 100 to 80 percent to provide additional liquidity 
and counter financial system risks. On April 6, the SARB issued guidance
 on dividend and cash bonuses distribution to ensure bank capital 
preservation. Effective May 11, the SARB returned the number of repo 
auctions to once a day and, on May 12, announced a series of prudential 
priority measures for co-operative financial institutions on prudential 
matters, supervisory activities, as well as governance and operational 
issues. On August 3, the SARB announced that the easing of 
macro-prudential policies would be extended until further notice. As of 
August 19, noting a normalization of liquidity conditions, the SARB 
reverted to standard standing facility borrowing rates (repo rate less

<h3>South Sudan, Republic of</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The Republic of South Sudan reported its
 first case of COVID-19 on April 4, 2020. The pandemic is progressing, 
and the first Vice President tested positive for coronavirus along with 
some other high-ranked government officials but recovered eventually. 
The government announced various precautionary measures, including 
(i)&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://eyeradio.org/s-sudan-bans-international-flights/" target="_blank">international flight suspension</a>&nbsp;(with
 few exceptions for planes bringing in health-related cargo, such as 
medicine and medical equipment, and essential/critical food items; (ii)

 curfews; (v)&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/coronavirus-south-sudan-bans-social-gatherings/1768378" target="_blank">social distancing</a>;
 and (vi) a mandatory 14-day quarantine period for any traveler arriving
 from a virus-affected country. The government also encouraged&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://eyeradio.org/kiir-imposes-night-curfew-asks-employers-to-have-some-staff-stay-home/" target="_blank">businesses to allow their employees to telework</a>&nbsp;and warned the business community against increasing prices and hoarding essential goods and commodities. </p>

<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>Lockdown measures were 
first partially lifted on May 7. More recently, the Council of Ministers
 instructed the Ministry of Education to reopen schools and higher 
learning institutions in an announcement made on September 18.  </p>

<h3>Spain</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Spain has been heavily affected by the 
COVID-19 outbreak, with the first infection case detected on February 
25, 2020. After a steady decline from April through mid-July, the daily 
new infection numbers are on the rise again, surpassing the peak of the 
first wave.  A state of emergency took effect on March 14, initially for
 15 days and then was repeatedly extended until June 21, with 
restrictions on movement to essential purposes only, limited commercial,
 cultural, recreational, hotel and restaurant activities, and reduced 
operation of public transport. From March 30-April 9, 2020, all 
non-essential activities were halted. Temporary restrictions were in 
place from May 15-24 on entries through ports and airports from Schengen
 countries, with only Spanish citizens, residents, cross-border workers,
 and health and elder care professionals allowed to enter. A 14-day 
quarantine for all people arriving from abroad was in place from May 15 
to June 21, with a few exceptions. In the first half of 2020, the 
Spanish economy shrank by 12.8 percent from the same period last year as
 measures to contain the outbreak induced an unprecedented decline in 
private consumption and plunge in investments.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The state of emergency was
 lifted on June 21, allowing for unconstrained mobility across all 
provinces and reopening of EU borders. Schools reopened for face-to-face
 teaching at all levels from September, with a series of preventive and 
hygienic measures in place including mandatory use of masks for 6 years 
and older. Social distancing requirements, capacity limitations, and 
hygiene measures at workplaces remain in place, including mandatory use 
of masks in closed spaces and on streets when a safety distance of 1.5 
meters cannot be maintained. Most regions adopted a requirement to wear a
 mask in all public spaces, and several regions reintroduced 
restrictions on certain public venues and large group gathering in 
response to reemergence of local outbreaks. A national closure of night 
clubs and bars was reintroduced on August 14. Localized restrictions on 
non-essential activities were reinstated in the Madrid region starting 
from September 21.</p>

<h3>Sri Lanka</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Sri Lanka reported its first COVID-19 
case in late January. New cases continue to be confirmed, but do not 
appear to be on an upward trend. The authorities have suspended arriving
 international flights and ships, excluding repatriations. The 
nation-wide curfew imposed since March 20 has been relaxed from June 6. 
As of early September, there have been net capital outflows of around 
US$500 million (0.6 percent of GDP) since mid February, mostly from the 
domestic treasury securities market. The Sri Lankan currency has also 
depreciated by around 2 percent against the US dollar since that time. 
Sri Lanka’s EMBIG spread remains about twice its mid-February level. </p>

<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government has allocated up to 0.1 percent of GDP for 
containment measures, as well as US$5 million (0.01 percent of GDP) to 
the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund. The President has announced cash 
payments totaling around 0.25 percent of GDP for vulnerable groups. The 
2020 H1 payment deadlines for income tax, VAT and certain other taxes 
were extended until end-Dec. Income tax arrears of SMEs have been 
partially waived off, more relaxed payment terms have been approved and 
legal actions against non-payers have been frozen. Other measures 
announced include tax exemptions for masks and disinfectant, additional 
energy subsidies, as well as concessional loans and food allowances for 
the poor. The President has also established a Task Force on Economic 
Revival and Poverty Eradication and a special fund for containment, 
mitigation and social welfare spending, inviting local and foreign 
tax-free donations. In late April, import duties on gasoline and diesel 
were increased to mitigate weak revenue collections, but this was 
reversed in late June.</p>

<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has reduced monetary policy 
rates by 200 basis points since March. The required reserves ratio of 
commercial banks has been lowered by 3 percentage points, the liquidity 
coverage and net stable funding ratios have been reduced to 90 percent 
and the interest rate on CBSL advances to banks has been lowered by 650 
bps. Commercial banks cannot declare dividends, share buy backs or 
increase payments to directors until end-2020. There is a debt repayment
 moratorium, including a six month moratorium on bank loans for the 
garment, plantation and IT sectors, and SMEs, with CBSL providing 
refinancing and concessional lending facilities of 1 percent of GDP, 
partially supported by a CBSL guarantee. A debt moratorium for the 
tourism sector will last until end-March 2021. In addition, the 
construction sector is eligible to borrow from banks with government 
guarantees. There will be a three-month moratorium on small-value 
personal banking and leasing loans. The interest rate on credit cards, 
overdrafts and pawning facilities will be capped. Financial institutions
 are also requested to reschedule non-performing loans, while capital 
conservation buffers and loan classification rules have been relaxed. In
 addition, state-owned institutions will invest in treasury securities 
to stabilize the money market rate at 7 percent.</p>

 of outward investment payments. There are also import restrictions of 
certain goods, including some agricultural produce and ethanol, as well 
as prohibiting commercial banks facilitating imports of vehicles. 
Outward remittances have been suspended, while inward remittances will 
be exempted from certain regulations and taxes. On July 24, CBSL and the
 Reserve Bank of India entered a US$400 million swap under the Framework
 on Currency Swap Arrangement for SAARC countries.</p>

<h3>Sudan</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The corona cases have flattened, with no new cases reported in past few days.  </p>
<p>The curfew and other containment measures put in place earlier have 
been removed and the borders are opening. The economic impact from 
COVID-19 and nearly 6- months of containment measures included increased
 price of basic foods, rising unemployment and falling exports, 
exacerbating the macroeconomic challenges the country was already 
facing. The negative supply shock combined with continued monetization 
of the fiscal deficit has increased the inflation to 167 percent as of 
August 2020.  </p>

August 10, 2020; the budget reflects the commitments under their 
home-grown 12-month SMP (July1, 2020 – June 30, 2020).  The approved 
budget includes new policy measures to address the current dire economic
 situation and reduce the impact of COVID-19. Key policy measures 
include removal of subsidies on gasoline and diesel, and exchange rate 
reforms, as well as increased domestic revenue mobilization. Sudan has 
very low domestic revenue collection, which declined by 40 percent due 
to COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>
    <p>While not directly related COVID-19, the international community 
also pledged support of US$ 1.8 billion for the authorities’ broader 
macroeconomic reform agenda during a Partnership Conference held in 
Berlin, Germany on June 25, 2020. While most of the funds will go to the

<h3>Suriname</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Suriname has had a second surge of COVID
 cases having eradicated the disease. As of July 1, there are 517  
cases, 13 deaths, and 529 persons in quarantine. Despite this, Suriname 
is relaxing lockdown measures to include: curfew from 8pm to 5am; 
companies and organizations may maintain their normal opening hours 
except: hotels, casinos, places of worship, covered vegetable, fruit, 
meat and fish markets, brothels and bars; social distancing must be 
maintained and masks worn; gyms remain closed and contact sports remain 
prohibited; restaurants are open for pickup and delivery only; residents
 of old people's and children's homes may have 1 visitor per day; 
domestic flights of persons and goods are allowed under strict 
guidelines; meetings may not exceed 5 persons; and national borders 
remain closed. Schools are expected to reopen July 6, but teachers’ 
unions are not in agreement.  New expanded measures for sealing the 
border were announced April 29, 2020 due to outbreaks in French Guiana 
along the eastern border of Suriname. Most government offices have 
limited hours or have closed completely. Suriname has received aid from 
Cuba in the form of medicine and 50 health professionals who are in the 
country to assist. The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), The 
Netherlands, and Brazil have also provided resources. </p>

 budget for health services. There are also funds being made available 
for Surinamese stranded abroad who cannot repatriate because of the ban 
on incoming flights.</p>
    <p>On April 8, the government passed the COVID-19 Exceptional 
Condition Act that is in force for 3 months and may be extended for 
another 3 months. The Act supersedes all prior law and consists of the 
following measures: provides 400 million SRD for health-related 
spending, converts all current government debt to the Central Bank to 
long-term debt and removes barriers to further monetary financing, 
removes the law on the public debt limit, allows the government to 
exceed the budget without having to inform the parliament, gives the 
government control over all media with regard to the crisis and allows 
the government to prosecute media for any news it deems as fake, grants 
the government power to take any unused private land or building for use
 to address the crisis.</p>
    <p>On May 11, the Minister of Finance announced two funds: one of

rates. On the regulatory side, commercial banks may now grant 3 to 6 
months deferral of payments to companies, institutions and individuals 
who are affected by COVID. If necessary, specific measures will be taken
 for each institution aimed at temporarily alleviating the solvency and

<h3>Switzerland</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Switzerland was one of the countries in 
Europe hit early and hard by COVID-19. The first confirmed case of 
COVID-19 was reported on February 24. On March 16, the Federal Council 
(FC) declared a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/massnahmen-des-bundes.html" target="_blank">national state of emergency</a>,
 closing all shops, restaurants, bars and entertainment facilities and 
schools (with exceptions for food stores and pharmacies), prohibiting 
public gatherings of 5 people or more, and recommending that all 
citizens stay home. Some heavily-affected cantons imposed tighter 
restrictions on activities. The government also introduced controls at 
all borders, with entry restrictions in place for citizens of both 
Schengen and non-Schengen countries. The number of active and new cases 
decreased sharply from mid/late April, but has been on a rise since 
mid-June with greater mobility and more testing (particularly in some 
cantons), although hospitalization and death numbers remained low. The 
drag from the containment and mitigation measures was exacerbated by 
external spillovers but partially mitigated by the authorities’ 
supportive policies. The economy contracted by 2.5 and 8.2 percent 
quarter-on-quarter in 2020Q1 and Q2, respectively, or 5.1 percent 
year-on-year in the first half of 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy. </strong>Since mid-April, the authorities have followed a well-articulated <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/massnahmen-des-bundes.html" target="_blank">3-phase plan</a>
 to gradually reopen the economy, making adjustments depending on 
developments. Activities and businesses such as medical and dental 
practices and hair salons resumed operations from April 27. A further 
easing on May 11 reopened primary and secondary schools, shops and 
markets, travel agencies, museums and libraries, and restaurants, bars 
and pubs, and allowed activities such as exams at educational 
institutions and some sports. Religious services, originally scheduled 
to resume on June 8, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-79204.html" target="_blank">were allowed from May 28</a>. On May 27, the FC <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79268.html" target="_blank">decided</a>
 to ease most of remaining restrictive measures from June 6, including 
permitting events with up to 300 people, and it announced that the 
national state of emergency would conclude on June 19. Events with more 
than 300 but less than 1,000 people were allowed again from June 22, and
 events with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-80054.html" target="_blank">1,000+ people</a> will resume from October 1. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-78940.html" target="_blank">Border restrictions have also been gradually loosened</a> from May 11, in consultation with neighboring countries. On June 15, Covid-19 related <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79426.html" target="_blank">entry restrictions were lifted</a>
 for all EU/EFTA states and the United Kingdom. On July 6, the 
restrictions on the admission of workers from some third countries (i.e.
 outside the EU and EFTA) were lifted. On July 1, following a similar 
decision by the EU, Switzerland decided to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-79711.html" target="_blank">reopen the borders</a>
 to 13 non-EU countries and 5 EU countries outside the Schengen area 
from July 20. The lists of countries with which Switzerland has open 
borders and of high-risk locations with mandatory quarantine for 
arrivals to Switzerland are periodically reviewed. However, in view of 
the increasing volume of people travelling and the rising number of new 
infections since mid-June, the FC decided on July 1 to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-79711.html" target="_blank">make masks compulsory</a> on all public transport from July 6 and on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-80054.html">all flights</a> taking off or landing in Switzerland from August 15. Some cantons have reintroduced additional restrictions, such as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cdt.ch/onthespot/lucerne-introduces-a-100-person-limit-across-bars-and-restaurants-LK2941863?refresh=true" target="_blank">limiting public events to 100 people</a>.
 On September 24, the Federal Office of Public Health started a new 
information campaign, “Just do it!”, focusing on tracing, testing, 
isolation and quarantine (TTIQ).</p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal (federal level)</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The FC announced a series of federal-level support packages amounting to CHF73 billion (10.4 percent of 2019 GDP). A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen/bundesrat.msg-id-78437.html" target="_blank">March 13 package (CHF10 billion</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span>
 included up to CHF8 billion for partial unemployment compensation, CHF1
 billion for financial aid to particularly-affected firms, CHF580 
million for loan guarantees for SMEs, and the rest for loss compensation
 for cancelled events. A second package (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen/bundesrat.msg-id-78515.html" target="_blank">March 20, CHF32 billion</a>)&nbsp;included:
 (i) extension of short-time work allowances and simplification of the 
application process; (ii) a guarantee program up to CHF20 billion to 
support bridging loans to SMEs (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-78572.html" target="_blank">details</a>);
 (iii) temporary, interest-free deferral of social-security contribution
 payments for affected companies; (iv) extended payment periods for 
taxes and payables to federal suppliers without incurrence of interest 
on arrears; and (v) compensation for loss of earnings for self-employed 
people (SE) and for some employees affected by official measures to 
combat the coronavirus (e.g., parents who need to take care of children 
with closing of schools).On March 25, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-78573.html" target="_blank">additional measures</a> of around CHF600 million per month were introduced. An April 3 package doubled <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-78684.html" target="_blank">the size of the loan guarantee program</a>
 to CHF40 billion. On April 8 and 16, the short-time work program was 
twice expanded to cover on-call workers and more SE, respectively. On 
April 22, the FC <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-78856.html" target="_blank">extended the loss compensation</a> for SE to May 16, even if they had reopened their businesses on an earlier date; and expanded the loan guarantee program for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-78872.html" target="_blank">startups</a>.
 On April 29, the FC announced CHF1.9 billion credit support to airlines
 and aviation-related businesses. The take-up of bridge loans under the 
federal guarantee program, which expired on July 31 (the program for 
startups will expire at the end of August), and assistance to 
self-employed, which will expire on September 16, has been lower than 
budgeted.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>Currently the focus of the government has shifted from providing 
an emergency lifeline to the economy to fine-tuning various support 
measures and ensuring policy continuity as the country transitions back 
to a more normalized situation, including, for instance, preparing the 
Covid-19 Act. so that some ordinances issued during the national 
emergency do not automatically expire after six months. On July 1, the 
government announced that it would: (i) provide additional financing 
help to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-79707.html" target="_blank">public transport and rail freight companies</a>; (ii) extend the revenue compensation for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-79685.html" target="_blank">self-employed persons</a> to mid-September; (iii) extend the maximum period of receiving <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-79716.html" target="_blank">short-time work compensation</a> from 12 months to 18 months; (iv) scale back Covid-19 related financial support to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-79701.html" target="_blank">international sports organizations</a>; and (v) <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-79683.html" target="_blank">legislate a new law</a>
 to regulate the bridge loan guarantee program beyond the period of 
national emergency. On August 12, the government announced a new set of 
fiscal measures, including CHF400 million financial support to air 
traffic control company Skyguide in 2020-21. On August 26, the FC 
decided to extend the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-80193.html" target="_blank">legal standstill for travel agencies</a> and the simplified regulation for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-80183.html" target="_blank">unemployment insurance</a> to the end of 2020</p>

    SNB announced
    </a>
    on March 19 that starting April 1, the threshold factor for exempting sight

    SNB
    </a>
    introduced a new COVID-19 refinancing facility that would operate in
    conjunction with the federal government’s guarantees for corporate loans,
    allowing banks to obtain liquidity from the SNB. This facility was subsequently <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.snb.ch/en/mmr/reference/pre_20200511/source/pre_20200511.en.pdf" target="_blank">revised</a> to allow use of loans guaranteed by cantons as a collateral.  The SNB’s request for
    deactivation of the countercyclical capital buffer was
    <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78604.html" target="_blank">
    approved by the FC
    </a>
    on March 27. On July 1, the SNB adjusted the rate calculation for its <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.snb.ch/en/mmr/reference/repo_rund_20200629/source/repo_rund_20200629.en.pdf" target="_blank">liquidity-shortage financing facility</a>,
 effectively lowering the borrowing cost from this facility. Through 
end-August, the SNB has maintained its policy rate at -0.75 percent. On 
the supervisory front, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority 
(FINMA) introduced a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2020/03/20200325-mm-garantiepaket/" target="_blank">temporary exclusion</a> of deposits held at central banks from the calculation of banks’ leverage ratio (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2020/05/20200519-news-aufsichtsmitteilung-062020/" target="_blank">extended on May 19, 2020</a>
 to until January 1, 2021). FINMA emphasized that the capital released 
from this relaxation should be used to support liquidity provision and 
is not to be distributed as dividends or other similar distributions 
related to 2019.

<h3>Tajikistan</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Tajikistan reported its first confirmed 
COVID-19 case on May 1, 2020. The authorities have instituted a 
high-level task force and taken a range of measures to contain the 
spread of the virus, including border closures, travel restrictions, and
 suspending prayers at mosques. On June 5, Tajikistan President issued a
 decree on Countering the Socio-Economic Impact of COVID-19. </p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe human and economic impact in 
Tajikistan. Trade and transportation disruptions have led to a sharp 
drop in remittances and government revenues and created urgent balance 
of payments and fiscal financing needs. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On June 6, the government 
presented a reopening plan. Accordingly, bazaars, cafes, beauty and 
hairdressing salons, and barber shops along other businesses are 
expected to resume operations in Tajikistan starting on June 15. All 
businesses must adhere strict cautionary measures, including regular 
disinfection of premises and observance of social distancing. While 
restrictions on public transport will be removed and intercity travel 
remains open, international flights are not expected to resume until 
further notice. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The authorities are seeing a decline in revenues and higher 
spending. The authorities have requested disbursement under IMF Rapid 
Credit Facility instrument. On May 6, The IMF Executive Board approved a
 disbursement of US$189.5 million for budget support to help Tajikistan.
 Discussions with other development partners, including the World Bank 
and Asian Development Bank are ongoing on financial support to 
Tajikistan. The authorities are concerned about debt sustainability and 
are preparing consolidation measures that can be implemented over the 
medium term.</p>
    <p>The Government is providing VAT exemptions on essential imports, 
lump-sum assistance equivalent to minimum wage to vulnerable households 
and other socially disadvantaged groups. Health workers are to receive 
supplemental pay, while tariff increases on electricity, water, and 
communal services have been postponed until end of 2020. Government is 
providing free medical care to citizens placed under medical care and 
COVID-19 patients, as well as sick leave and compensation benefits. 
Government is providing grain, seed and fuel to farms to boost food 
security, and time-bound tax holidays and relief to targeted industries 
and small businesses until September 1, 2020. Anti-COVID measures also 
include financial support to SMEs and subsidizing food for population. 
Recently, Tajikistan was granted a debt relief around USD50 million 
under G20 DSSI initiative. These funds were also included to anti-COVID 
envelop under supplementary budget currently being discussed in the 
Parliament.   </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The NBT has taken measures to ease monetary and liquidity 
conditions and adopted an Action Plan to address effects of pandemic on 
the banking sector. It allowed a one-off 5 percent exchange rate 
depreciation in March and greater exchange rate flexibility to align the
 official rate with the market rate is also envisaged. The policy rate 
was cut by 100 basis points in April and 100 basis points in August to 
10.75 percent. On the face of mounting pressures, it lowered reserve 
requirements, relaxed enforcement of prudential requirements, and 
provided foreign exchange liquidity. It is also promoting the use of 
electronic payments to facilitate remote transactions.</p>
    <p>Prices of staple goods have pushed headline inflation around 
outside of the NBT’s target range in April – May, slowing to 7percent in
 August. The Presidential decree mandated the Government to administer 
prices of key consumer goods and medical supplies. </p>
    <p>The NBT has relaxed enforcement of prudential requirements to 
ease banking pressures and maintain credit. In April, the NBT 
recommended the banks to review loan terms to support borrowers facing 
temporary difficulties. It also recommended banks to waive penalties for
 businesses and individuals that face hardships in repaying their loan 
obligations between May and October 2020. To accommodate these the NBT 
temporarily (until September) waived supervisory sanctions against those
 banks that are providing adequate loan loss provisions and as a result 
fail to meet capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio. Banks have 
already restructured over 46 thousand loans and these loans are being 
tracked separately. Despite a temporary waiver of penalties, credit 
institutions are required to ensure that established prudential 
requirements are met. The NBT has recommended that credit institutions 
not pay dividends or bonuses to shareholders, but keep these profits to 
boost capital. Credit institutions are exempt from paying fees for the 
settlement system and have been asked to avoid non-essential 
expenditures. To reduce the impetus for dollarization, the income tax 
rate for interest income on domestic currency deposits was lowered till 
end-December 2020 by 5 percent.  </p>
    <p>In April, required reserve ratios were lowered from 3 percent to 1
 percent and from 9 percent to 5 percent for local currency and foreign 
exchange deposits, respectively. Government plans to disburse 
preferential loans to food and medical supply producing companies 
through the Fund for State Support to Entrepreneurship. Interest rate on
 bank deposits have been lowered from 12 to 6 percent from July 1 to 
December 31, 2020.  The NBT recommended the banks to consider 
restructuring (i.e extending maturity) loans that face temporary 
hardship.</p>

received grants and will use contingency reserve of US$3.2 million to 
fund additional health spending to mitigate the risks of the pandemic.</p>
    <p>To support the private sector, the authorities indicated that 
they expedited the payment of verified expenditure arrears with priority
 given to the affected SMEs, paying US$376 million in March 2020. The 
government has also expanded social security schemes by US$32.1 million

<h3>Thailand</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on January 13, 2020. Recent cases have been identified in 
individuals in quarantine centers, upon entry to the country. Only one 
local transmission has been reported since late May, in early September.
 A state of emergency, instituted on March 26, has been extended to 
end-September. International flights transporting Covid-19 passengers 
are banned from transiting through Thailand. Covid-19 led to a 12.2 
percent contraction, year-on-year, in Q2-2020 GDP. As of September 24, 
Thailand had reported 3,516 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 59 deaths.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Phase 6 of the reopening 
began on August 1 allowing entry to certain non-Thai visitors, 
including: medical tourists, filming crews, Thailand Elite card members,
 foreigners who have work permits, foreigners married to Thai nationals 
and foreigners studying at educational institutions. The mandatory 
14-day quarantine does not apply to diplomats, but they must get tested 
at the airport. More than 100,000 migrant workers from nearby Myanmar, 
Cambodia and Laos have been allowed entry starting on August 1. The 
travel bubble plan for leisure travelers expected in August has been 
postponed in view of renewed outbreaks in some of the countries in the 
region.  In phase 5, schools and high-risk entertainment venues, such as
 pubs and massage parlors, reopened; and 40 long-distance and tourism 
trains resumed services. </p>

    <p>Cabinet has approved a fiscal package with phases I, II, and III 
amounting to at least 9.6 percent of GDP or THB 1.5 trillion including: 
i) health-related spending; ii) assistance for workers, farmers, and 
entrepreneurs affected by Covid-19 (includes THB 5,000 per month per 
person for three months to about 14 million non-farm workers outside the
 social security system and 10 million farmers); iii) support for 
individuals and businesses through soft loans and tax relief; (iv) lower
 water and electricity bills, and social security contributions; and (v)
 measures to support local tourism with THB 22 billion in subsidies for 
tourists and THB 100 bn in soft loans for SMEs in the sector. While part
 of this would be financed within the original FY 2020 budget or by 
reallocating funds from other financial assets to soft loans, 5.3 
percent of GDP or THB 1 trillion in additional borrowing has been 
authorized. From July 15 until end-October, there is also a tourism 
subsidy package, “We Travel Together,” covering up to 40 percent of 
certain travel costs for up to 5 million domestic tourists who must 
register. 4.65 million registrations have been received so far and 1 
percent of the trips have already taken place. In addition, on September
 22 the government passed a new shopping subsidy package for welfare 
cardholders worth THB 51 billion, financed by the government’s 
additional borrowing.</p>

    <p>The policy rate has been reduced by 75 bps from 1.25 to 0.50 
percent during 2020 and the contribution from financial institutions to 
the FIDF was reduced from 0.46 to 0.23 percent of the deposit base to 
provide space for future decreases in lending rates. In addition, 
measures to help businesses include: (i) soft loans by the Bank of 
Thailand (BOT) to financial institutions amounting to THB 500 billion 
for on-lending to SMEs; the government covers the first 6 months of 
interest and guarantees up to 60-70 percent of these loans; (ii) 
relaxation of repayment conditions for businesses including a loan 
payment holiday of 6 months for SMEs; and suspension of principal and 
reduction of interest on the debts to SFIs.</p>
    <p>Measures to support stability in the financial sector include: 
(i) a Corporate Bond Stabilization Fund (BSF) established for the BOT to
 provide bridge financing of up to THB 400 billion to high-quality firms
 with bonds maturing during 2020-2021, at higher-than-market ‘penalty’ 
rates; (ii) BOT purchase of government bonds to ensure the normal 
functioning of the government bond market; (iii) reduction in BOT bond 
issuances; and (iv) a special facility to provide liquidity for mutual 
funds through banks.  </p>

<h3>Timor-Leste</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste 
re-imposed a state of emergency on August 6 after the first COVID-19 
case in about 3 months was confirmed. The state of emergency covers the 
entire national territory and will be in force until October 4. It 
entails further restrictions on the entry of people by land, sea or air 
to prevent the spread of the virus. Domestic economic activity is not 
restricted. From September 29, four land borders will be opened for 3 
hours every 17 days for the international travels with important 
purposes. The country was under state of emergency during April-June.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>

<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On April 20, the government approved a stimulus package (US$150 
million, about 10.5 percent of GDP) to manage economic and financial 
risks from the COVID-19 including: (i) cash transfers with a monthly 
basic income to over 214,000 households, worth US$100 per month per 
household, lasting for 3 months; wage subsidies (60 percent of the wage 
cost) for formal sector employees (for 30,000 workers); (ii) the 
purchase of three months emergency supply of rice; (iii) maintaining 
transportation channels for movement of essential goods and 
medical/emergency goods; (iv) waiving for three months (for low-income 
households) the payment of electricity (up to US$15 per month), water 
bills, property rental payments owned by the government and social 
security contributions;(v) provide stipends to over 4,200 Timorese 
students studying overseas; and (vi) deferral of tax payments for two 
months. On September 23, the government decided to distribute cash 
transfers for basic staple foods to eligible households, worth US$25 per
 month per household, lasting for 2 months (November and December).  </p>

<h3>Togo</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 7, 2020. The number of active cases that had been 
trending upward slowly has been relatively stable since late August. 
Given its position as a regional transportation hub (serving as a base 
of a pan-African airline company) and strong trade ties with Asia, Togo 
is particularly exposed to the COVID-19. In order to contain the 
outbreak, Togo has taken a series of measures including (i) mandatory 
14-day quarantine for citizens and permanent residents upon entry and 
entries of non-citizens from high-infection countries banned; (ii) 
gatherings of more than 100 people banned; and (iii) schools remain 
closed. Furthermore, all sport or cultural events have been adjourned. 
In response to the worrying situation in the central region, the 
government ordered the closure of the towns of Sokodé, Tchamba and 
Adjengré and instituted a curfew in the prefectures of Tchaoudjo, 
Sotouboua and Tchamba as of August 25, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy</strong>. The curfew affecting Lomé 
and its surroundings was lifted on June 9. The airport in Lomé that had 
been closed for several months reopened for international air traffic on
 August 1, 2020 and the closure of land borders and airspace for flights
 from high-infection countries has been lifted.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The National Assembly has extended the state of health emergency 
for 6 months, until March 2021, and during this period the Government 
remains authorized to rule by decrees  to accelerate the decision-making
 process. Togo was one of the first African countries to respond to the 
crisis, developing and quickly implementing the most urgent components 
of a comprehensive, multi-year response plan that aims to protect lives,
 livelihoods, and future growth prospects. This comprehensive economic 
and social resilience plan seeks to upgrade the health system, contain 
the economic fallout of the crisis, and provide targeted support to 
vulnerable households and firms. It is comprised of measures targeting: </p>
    <p>Health: The state of health emergency declared on April 1 
triggered the implementation of a set of containment and mitigation 
measures, including strengthening laboratory diagnostic capacity, 
equipping treatment centers, improving drug availability, and the launch
 of a vast program to rehabilitate hospitals and to provide health 
centers with standard infrastructure to screen and treat people with 
COVID-19. The authorities are projecting spending on containment and 
mitigation measures of CFAF 19 billion ($32 million; 0.6 percent of GDP)
 in 2020 and additional spending on construction of health centers and 
purchases of medical equipment of at least CFAF 33 billion ($59 million;
 1.0 percent of GDP). In addition, imports of medical equipment and 
other products used exclusively in the fight against COVID-19 have been 
exonerated from taxes and duties at an estimated cost of CFAF 7 billion 
($12 million; 0.2 percent of GDP).</p>
    <p>Social objectives: A new mobile cash-transfer program, NOVISSI, 
aiming to support informal workers was launched in April. Eligible 
applicants receive a state grant of at least 30 percent of the minimum 
wage, with payouts from CFAF 10,500 ($18) to CFAF 20,000 ($34). Based on
 program data, 65 percent of the beneficiaries are women. The Novissi 
program was revised in late June with eligibility limited to workers in 
specific districts recording a high contagion rate. In total, 1.4 
million individuals have registered and close to 600,000 have received a
 NOVISSI payment at a total cost of CFAF 11.7 billion ($21 million; 0.4 
percent of GDP) so far. The Government did also subsidize water and 
electricity use for groups paying social tariffs for three months. The 
total cost is estimated at CFAF 3.8 billion ($6 million; 0.1 percent of 
GDP).</p>
    <p>Economic recovery: The Government has adopted a series of tax 
policy and administrative measures to prepare the country for the future
 economic recovery, including: (i) all procedures for forced tax 
collections and ongoing tax prosecutions remain suspended during the 
state of emergency; (ii) the standard VAT rate of 18 percent has been 
reduced to 10 percent for firms in the hospitality and catering sectors;
 and (iii) tax audits and penalties for the late payment of taxes due in
 the second quarter of 2020 were suspended. In addition, submission 
deadlines for businesses that cannot submit their tax declarations on 
time have been rescheduled and small- and medium-sized enterprises are 
allowed to pay taxes in tranches and enjoy more flexibility regarding 
outstanding taxes due. Small-scale farmers have received vouchers for 
the purchase of inputs.</p>
    <p>Financing for the response is severely constrained. Relative to 
the original budget for 2020, revenue collections are expected to fall 
by at least CFAF 94 billion ($170 million; 2.8 percent of GDP). The 
decline is attributed to both slower economic growth and tax measures in
 response to the pandemic. To meet these needs, the Government has 
established a national solidarity fund, to include contributions from 
the state budget, development partners, and voluntary donations from the
 private sector and the Togolese diaspora. The IMF has already provided 
significant financing, approving an ECF disbursement (with an augmented 
quota) of US$131 million, while bilateral donors have focused on 
providing project support. The solidarity fund is still underfinanced.</p>
    <p>Heads of states of the West-Africa Economic and Monetary Union 
(WAEMU) have declared a temporary suspension of the WAEMU growth and 
stability pact (setting six convergence criteria, including the 3 
percent of GDP fiscal deficit limit) to help member-countries cope with 
the&nbsp; fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, member 
countries are allowed to raise their overall fiscal deficit temporarily 
and use any additional external support provided by donors in response 
to the Covid-19 crisis. The declaration by the heads of states sets a 
clear expectation that fiscal consolidation will resume once the crisis 
is over.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The regional central bank (BCEAO) for the West-African Economic 
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has taken steps to better satisfy banks’ 
demand for liquidity and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on
 economic activity. The BCEAO adopted of a full allotment strategy at a 
fixed rate of 2.5 percent (the minimum policy rate) thereby allowing 
banks to satisfy their liquidity needs fully at rate about 25 basis 
points lower than before the crisis. On June 22, the Monetary Policy 
Committee cut by 50 basis points the ceiling and the floor of the 
monetary policy corridor, to 4 and 2 percent respectively. The BCEAO has
 also announced: (i) an extension of the collateral framework to access 
central bank refinancing to include bank loans to prequalified 1,700 
private companies; (ii) a framework inviting banks and microfinance 
institutions to accommodate demands from customers with Covid19-related 
repayment difficulties to postpone for a 3 month renewable period debt 
service falling due, without the need to classify such postponed claims 
as non performing; and (iii) measures to promote the use of electronic 
payments. In addition, the BCEAO launched a special 3-month refinancing 
window at a fixed rate of 2.5 percent for limited amounts of 3-month 
"Covid-19 T-Bills" to be issued by each WAEMU sovereign to help meet 
immediate funding needs related to the current pandemic. The amount of 
such special T-Bills issued by Togo was the equivalent of 3.2 percent of
 GDP. When the special T-Bills matured in August, Togo was allowed to 
issue the equivalent of 2.1 percent of GDP of new 3-months Covid-19 
T-Bills that banks may refinance with the BCEAO for their term to 
maturity at 2 percent. Finally, WAEMU authorities have extended by one 
year the five-year period initiated in 2018 for the transition to Basle 
II/III bank prudential requirements. In particular, the regulatory 
capital adequacy ratio will remain unchanged at end-2020 from its 2019 
level of 9.5 percent, before gradually increasing to 11.5 percent by 
2023 instead of 2022 as initially planned. </p>

<h3>Tonga</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>As of September 25, 2020, there have 
been no reported COVID-19 cases in Tonga. Nevertheless, the economy is 
being hit hard by a sharp slowdown in partner countries, which are an 
important source of remittances and tourism for the economy, and the 
containment measures that have been imposed. The Government of Tonga 
introduced restrictive containment measures starting in January 2020. In
 March 2020, it declared a state of National Emergency and toughened 
measures for incoming travelers (including international cruise ships 
and yachts passengers) before prohibiting all passengers flights into 
the country. Other preventive measures include a national lockdown, a 
national curfew, the closure of non-essential businesses and public 
facilities, movement restrictions and the prohibition of public 
gatherings.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening the economy. </strong>The authorities started 
easing restrictions on April 12, 2020, by lifting the national lockdown,
 and domestic restrictions were further eased on June 11, for example by
 further reducing curfew hours and removing the prohibition on contact 
sports. The state of National Emergency and the border closure, however,
 have been extended until September 28 and September 12, respectively.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 25, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Based on an initial assessment of the overall impact of COVID-19 
on the economy, the Government of Tonga announced an Economic and Social
 Stimulus Package of 60 million Tongan pa’anga (5.3 percent of GDP) for 
FY2020 on April 2, 2020. This package was intended to provide short-term
 assistance to all affected sectors in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Over a third of the funds were to be directed to the health 
sector, while the rest were to support the other sectors, including 
tourism, transport, agriculture, education and security. In addition, 
the Government of Tonga announced a 3-month moratorium on Government 
Development Loans &amp; TC Gita Recovery Loan Fund, deferral of 
retirement contributions and hardship allowances for laid-off employees 
(up to 3 months), needs-based financial assistance, tax and duty relief 
during the pandemic, and assistance with the payment of utility bills by
 public enterprises. The FY2021 budget, approved by Parliament on June 
22, envisages a deficit of 37.4 million Tongan pa’anga (some 3½ percent 
of GDP) for FY2021. Spending on health has been identified as one of the
 top priorities for the government, accounting for 21 percent of the 
total budget of 589.6 million Tongan pa’anga.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On March 19, 2020, the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) 
Board approved the provision of liquidity support to the banking system.
 It also committed to easing exchange control requirements if needed. It
 placed monetary policy, which was accommodative given low inflation and
 slow economic recovery, on hold. The NRBT started meeting weekly with 
banks to ensure there is clear communication, enhanced preparedness and 
best practices. It is supporting banks in their effort to mitigate the 
negative impact of the COVID-19 virus on the economy as well as provide 
essential financial services to households and businesses. Commercial 
banks are assisting their customers affected by the COVID-19 virus on a 
case by case basis and depending on individual customers’ circumstances 
by: (i) reducing or suspending the principal loan repayments to interest
 only loan repayments; (ii) restructuring loans to businesses that have 
reduced business hours, in affected sectors such as tourism and related 
industries like transportation and to individuals who have been laid 
off; (iii) extending the terms of loans to reduce repayments; (iv) 
reducing loan interest rates on a case by case basis; and (v) providing 
access to short-term funding, if required. The NRBT is also building 
awareness and expectations through press releases. At end-August, the 
NRBT announced that its monetary and financial sector policy stance will
 continue unchanged, given the weak economy. </p>

    <p>The exchange rate remains pegged against a basket of currencies 
(within a ±5 percent monthly adjustment limit). No new exchange 
restrictions have been announced. International reserves remained 
relatively constant at around 7.6 months of imports from the beginning 
of the year until end-June 2020 - before rising sharply to 8.5 months of
 imports (555.9 million Tongan pa’anga) by end-July 2020 - due to 
inflows of remittances and budget support and grants from international 
donors. </p>

<h3>Trinidad and Tobago</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Trinidad and Tobago is being hit by two 
shocks, the spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in oil prices. The 
first confirmed case was reported on March 12, 2020 and the number of 
cases stabilized until mid-July but have increased tenfold in the past 
two months. The government had adopted containment measures, including 
border closures, travel restrictions, school and university closures, 
and limits on social gatherings.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening the economy.</strong> The government had put in 
place a reopening plan in phases starting May 10, and all economic 
activities had resumed by end-June. Given the new wave of COVID-19, 
several &nbsp;containment measures have been re-introduced for four 
weeks, beginning August 17. The country’s borders will remain closed 
until further notice.</p>

    <p>On March 17, the central bank reduced the policy rate by 150 bps 
to 3.5 percent, and the reserve requirement on commercial bank deposits 
by 300 bps to 14 percent. As a result, commercial banks have reduced the
 prime lending rate to an average of 7½ percent, from 9¼ percent 
previously. Additionally, commercial banks agreed to provide a 1-month 
moratorium on mortgages and installment loan payments, without any 
penalty; and to waive penalty interest on overdraft facilities. Several 
banks have offered automatic deferrals for a period of up to 6 months on
 loans or credit card payments due. Other government housing 
institutions have provided similar relief to their customers with 2 to 6
 months payment deferrals. Money lenders allowed deferred payments and 
reduced interest rates. Credit cards have reduced interest rates and 
increased credit limits.</p>

<h3>Tunisia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Tunisia reported its first confirmed 
case on March 2, 2020. Thanks to proactive actions from the Tunisian 
authorities in taking the necessary sanitary steps, declaring a national
 state of emergency, and adopting confinement measures, the pandemic has
 remained contained, with a low number of daily contamination cases 
mostly coming from abroad. Tunisia began on June 4, 2020 a strategy of 
deconfinement and the reopening of borders was effective on June 27, 
2020. The COVID-19 shock came at a time when Tunisia was already facing 
persistent macroeconomic imbalances.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On April 29, the national 
security council announced several measures to ease economic 
restrictions by adopting a three-phased plan depending on the activity 
sector. The first phase started on May 4 and concerned the most affected
 sectors–individuals and craftsmen, manufacturers especially export 
firms, with the obligation of adopting sufficient sanitary measures. The
 second phase  began on May 24 and concerned supermarkets, cafés, and 
other individuals for which the social distancing would be hard to 
establish. The third phase of full deconfinement started on June 4. 
During the transition period, only 50 percent of the public sector got 
back to business. On June 27 Tunisia started easing international travel
 restrictions and opening frontiers progressively, classifying countries
 in three lists according to the pandemic risk and applying different 
measures for each list.</p>
<p>On August 21st, the government has decided to make mandatory the 
wearing of masks in administrations and most public and commercial 
places following the reopening of the borders which led to a further 
increase in the number of new cases in Tunisia.</p>

 the acceleration of VAT refund procedures; the rescheduling taxes and 
custom arrears; and liquidity easing measures for the private sector, in
 order to limit layoffs and protect the most vulnerable, especially in 
the informal sector. The plan also includes an expansion of the budget 
allocation for health expenses and the creation of a TND 100 million 
fund for public hospitals to purchase equipment. On the social side, the
 package included cash transfers for low income households and for 
disabled and homeless people (TND 450 million for three months). The

<h3>Turkey</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first case of COVID-19 was reported 
on March 11, 2020. The government adopted multiple containment measures 
to address the pandemic including: social distancing, curfews, travel 
bans along with quarantines for returning nationals, and the closures of
 schools/universities, stores, and entertainment venues. The Health 
Minister announced that the government launched nationwide coronavirus 
antibody tests on June, covering randomly selected people across all  81
 provinces GDP contracted by 9.9% y-o-y in Q2 following expansions of 
4.4% y-o-y in Q1 and 6.0 percent y-o-y over the last quarter of 2019.  </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On May 4, following 
reported improvements in Covid-19 statistics, the government announced a
 phased approach to lifting lockdown measures from May to July. In the 
first phase, certain retail shops opened from May 11, while plans were 
announced regarding universities and the judiciary resuming their 
activities in mid-June. In late May, the authorities announced their 
intention to lift most of the COVID-related restrictions, effective from
 June 1, including: removal of travel restrictions between 15 major 
cities, reopening of restaurants, cafes, sporting facilities and 
government institutions, and the resumption of domestic flights. On June
 10, a new reopening measures were announced, including the phased 
resumption of international flights, with plans to fly to 40 countries 
by the end of June; curfews on people aged below 18 and over 65 were 
eased; and opening times for restaurants, cafes, and similar businesses 
were extended. Schools will start the 2020-2021 education year on August
 31, initially through remote learning, with a gradual return to 
classrooms expected in late-September. On June 12, Turkey opened all of 
its land borders, with the exception of Iran. All those entering Turkey 
undergo medical screening upon entry into the country. In mid-June, the 
authorities announced targeted measures in response to an uptick of 
reported Covid-19 cases, including: the mandatory use of face masks in 
public areas in Istanbul, Ankara and Bursa, and the reinstatement of 
limited weekend curfews (related especially to nationwide high school 
and higher education entrance exams). On June 25, restrictions on travel
 for tourism purposes by citizens aged 65 were eased. Turkey and Russia 
agreed to resume flights as of July 15. On July 31, a Presidential 
Decree extended, again, the nationwide ban on layoffs by one month when 
the current ban expires on August 17. On August 26, a Presidential 
Decree allowed state institutions to introduce flexible working 
modalities to help stem the rise in case numbers. On September 4, a 
nationwide ban on layoffs was extended by two months when the current 
ban expires on September 17. On September 8, the wearing of masks was 
mandated in all public areas to contain an uptick in coronavirus cases. 
On September 9, the government revised plans for a return to 
face-to-face education with only pre-school and first-year pupils 
expected to return to in-person classes on September 21.  </p>

the coronavirus.</p>
<p>In January 2020, the Extraordinary Commission on combatting the spread of disease was set up.</p>
<p>The authorities adopted a wide range of measures to prevent a 
COVID-19 outbreak, including closure of borders, flight cancellations 
and rerouting, and mandatory COVID-19 testing for arriving travelers. 
Starting from March 19, Turkmen citizens and citizens of other states 
were not allowed to enter Turkmenistan without a certificate of absence 
of COVID-19. From March 20 to April 20, foreign nationals were barred 
from crossing the state border of Turkmenistan.</p>

<h3>Tuvalu</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> As of September 24, 2020, Tuvalu has no 
reported cases of COVID-19 within its borders. Tuvalu has established a 
COVID-19 National Health Taskforce that will act as an Advisory body to 
Cabinet and provide updates on a regular basis. The Taskforce has 
recommended, and Cabinet approved, a 14 days quarantine period for 
anyone traveling into the country that has transited or originated their
 travel in a high risk country. Quarantine is being observed in Fiji, or
 if someone was to slip through the net, they would be isolated in 
Tuvalu for 14 days to observe the same 14 days quarantine period. The 
State of Public Health Emergency, which was first declared on March 20, 
2020, was extended for six months on March 26, 2020. The government has 
subsequently imposed restrictions on any aircraft and vessels traveling 
to the country. The government further announced on April 13, 2020 that 
it is intending to repatriate all Tuvaluan students studying overseas.

supplementary budget to provide employment opportunities, promote local 
production of food in the agriculture sector, improve financing to the 
private sector in rural areas and maintain welfare.   </p>
<p>The Government encourage those who are unemployed, living on the 
capital and are not residents of the capital, to temporary migrate to 
their home island with the Government to finance their boat fares. This 
is to ease pressure on key Government services on the capital such as 
water and medical services and also to minimize the risk of spreading 
any communicable disease. </p>

<h3>Uganda</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Corona virus positivity rates have 
increased since the easing of most of the lockdown measures. Community 
infections are on the rise but the death rate has remained low. The 
increasing cases have somewhat strained hospital capacity though the 
authorities have identified additional space for patient management. In 
addition, the authorities have recruited additional staff/ volunteers to
 assist with the management of the pandemic. Funding for scaling up of 
testing continues to be mobilized. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Uganda has gradually 
relaxed one of the most stringent lockdowns in the region that started 
in late May by: (i) allowing the movement of private cars, albeit with  a
 limit in place on number of passengers; (ii) reopening sequentially 
merchandise shops; (iii) relaunching public transport with strict 
regulation on passenger capacity and obligation to wear masks; and (iv) 
shortening the curfew to 9.00 PM–5.30 AM. Schools will reopen for 
candidate classes, universities and other tertiary institutions for all 
final year students starting September 20. International commercial 
flights will resume starting October 1.</p>
<p>The Consultative Meeting of the East African Community (EAC) heads of
 state held on May 12th agreed on a harmonized regional response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic that includes: (i) adopting  a harmonized system for 
certification and sharing of test results; (ii) establishing a regional 
mechanism for testing and certifying truck drivers and the adoption of 
an EAC digital surveillance and tracking system for drivers and crew; 
(iii) supporting agro-processing and value chains; and (iv) establishing
 special purpose financing schemes for SMEs. </p>

Response Plan from January with approximately $1.3 million to June 2020.
  Two supplementary budgets have increased the spending envelope for 
critical sectors and vulnerable groups by about US$370 million. In 
addition, the government has announced the following measures:</p>
    </li>
    <p> i. accelerating import substitution and export promotion by 
providing additional funding to the Uganda Development Bank (UDB), 
recapitalizing the Uganda Development Cooperation (UDC) and accelerating
 the development of industrial parks;  </p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Bank of Uganda (BoU) maintained its policy rate at 7 percent 
in August 2020, following two consecutive 100 basis points reduction in 
April and June. The BoU remains committed to providing liquidity support
 to for a period of up to one year to supervised financial institutions 
in need and putting in place a mechanism to minimize the likelihood of 
insolvency due to lack of credit. The BoU waived limitations on 
restructuring of credit facilities at financial institutions that may be
 at risk of going into distress and has also worked with mobile money 
providers and commercial banks to ensure they reduce charges on mobile 
money transactions and other digital payment charges. All Supervised 
Financial Institutions (SFIs) were directed to defer dividend payments 
and bonuses for at least 90 days effective March 2020 to ensure capital 
adequacy. Other measures include purchases of Treasury Bonds held by 
microfinance deposit taking institutions and credit institutions to ease

<h3>Ukraine</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 3, 2020. As the number of the new cases has been 
rising in June, international travel to most destinations for Ukrainian 
citizens has been banned. Starting in mid-March, daycare, schools and 
universities were closed, and domestic and international travel 
restrictions were imposed. Subsequently, restrictions were expanded to 
cover virtually all establishments which had physical interactions with 
clients. Citizens were required to carry identification papers and wear 
facial masks when outside. All people coming from abroad should go 
through a mandatory observation for 14 days, which was later changed 
into a self-isolation requirement. People over 60 were required to 
self-isolate. The government has also banned export of certain medical 
essentials, such as facial masks, personal protective equipment and 
ethyl alcohol, as well as some essential food stuffs. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The government has 
extended the quarantine until October 31st, but part of the restrictive 
measures have been softened starting May 11th. On May 11th beauty 
salons, most shops, museums, and outdoor terraces in restaurants were 
allowed to reopen, provided that certain sanitary norms are observed. 
Subways in large cities were opened on May 25th. The national railway 
operator was allowed to resume certain domestic and international 
routes. People over 60 are no longer required to self-isolate. 
Restaurants and cafes are now allowed to operate, including indoor 
seating, and sanitary requirements for religious gatherings were 
relaxed. Regions with better epidemiological situations are eligible for
 more relaxations, such as domestic bus and railway transportation, 
opening of daycare, certain education facilities, hotels and fitness 
centers (all with prescribed sanitary norms). Each region has been 
assigned a special commission, which can toughen the quarantine rules if
 the epidemiological situation worsens. In addition, domestic flights 
started on June 5, and limited international travel was allowed to 
resume starting June 15. A number of cross-border check-points were 
opened in June. Ukraine introduced its own list of risky countries; 
visitors coming from those will face additional restrictions (to be 
updated weekly).  On July 11th government forbid restaurants, bars and 
entertainment facilities to host clients from 11 pm to 7 am.  The 
government plans to strengthen responsibility for owners/managers of 
public places and public transportation if their visitors/customers do 
not wear masks. Starting August 1st, the government has been dividing 
Ukraine into four quarantine zones (green, yellow, orange and red), 
depending on the epidemiological situation. This delineation defines 
restrictions that will be imposed. Foreigners, except for holders of a 
residence permit, members of international missions and organizations, 
truck drives and certain other categories are banned from entering 
Ukraine for the month of September. Later foreigners going through 
Ukraine in transit were also banned from entering. The ban on night 
clubs, entertainment centers, and most concerts was reintroduced on 
August 26.</p>

calculation of personal income tax. The government has introduced a 
one-off pension increase to low-income pensioners of UAH1,000 in April 
and a regular monthly UAH500 pension top-up for retirees aged 80 years 
or more. The authorities’ policies also include an earlier-than-planned 
indexation adjustment of pensions in 2020, as well as a moratorium on 
penalties and disconnection of consumers who are late on utility 
payments.</p>
    <p>Medicines, medical devices and other equipment used to prevent or
 combat COVID-19 have been exempt from import duties and VAT. The 
government has created a temporary stand-alone budgetary program under 
the Finance Ministry to fight the pandemic. This program allows for a 
greater flexibility in the reallocation of funds to quickly accommodate 
changing priorities. The Accounting Chamber is monitoring COVID-related 
health expenditures from all tiers of the government 
https://public.tableau.com/profile/ua.gov.covid19#!/vizhome/COVID-19UKRAINE/COVID_19.&nbsp;The
 Finance Ministry’s infographics could be found at</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mof.gov.ua/uk/data_and_analytics-433">https://www.mof.gov.ua/uk/data_and_analytics-433</a></p>
    <p>All of the UAH 64,669 billion originally budgeted for this Fund 
has been appropriated among respective programs. De facto cash 
expenditures are made at slower pace; UAH 24.1 billion executed as of 
September 24. The government has a discretion to replenish the COVID 
fund by reallocating resources from other programs. Such an injection of
 UAH 2.6 billion was made on July 22.  </p>
    <p>Parliament has introduced a state insurance for medical 
professionals who become disabled as a result of COVID-19-related 
sickness. This insurance also covers the families of doctors and nurses 
who die as a result of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The government has expanded the subsidized loans program—the 
so-called 5-7-9 program—and credit guarantee scheme (launched in 
February 2020). The maximum amount of a loan has been increased to UAH3 
million (about US$100,000), the annual income limit to UAH100 million 
(US$3.7 million), and the eligibility criteria have been expanded to 
include COVID-19 crisis related production as well as production costs 
(e.g., wages and rent). The government has further expanded the program 
to make it more generous and accessible (for example if loans are used 
for refinancing outstanding credit to banks). As of September 17, 3,238 
loans were extended under the program worth UAH 7.8 billion.  </p>
    <p>The authorities have softened access to a number of social 
support programs, such as household utilities subsidies and aid to 
families with children. The changes include (a) increasing norms (by 50 
percent) for energy consumption used to determine the amount of subsidy;
 (b) stopping the disqualification from the household utilities 
subsidies program of a person that breaches qualification criteria; (c) 
automatic re-enrollment into the program for the heating season 
2020-2021; (d) extending existing social entitlements for the period of 
the quarantine without the need to reapply; and (e) making private 
entrepreneurs eligible for the state support for children younger than 
10. The latter program has so far cost UAH 1.1 billion, half of which 
has already been spent.</p>
    <p>The floor for unemployment benefit has been increased from UAH 
650 to UAH 1,000 for applicants whose employment history does not 
qualify them for a full benefit. For those with sufficient records of 
participation in labor market and contributions to pension system, this 
minimum amount is increased from UAH 1,630 to 1,800. The law governing 
unemployment benefits has been amended to introduce a new type of 
entitlement, so called furlough benefit related to a quarantine. The 
Cabinet of Ministers has been granted the right to determine its amount 
and set it at 2/3 of the basic wage, but not exceeding the minimum wage 
which is UAH 4,723. Employers are compensated for wages paid to 
partially furloughed employees, under the provision that pension 
contributions were paid in the six months prior to the quarantine. The 
first disbursement of UAH 2.3 billion for this purpose from the COVID 
fund in the budget has been executed, in parallel with UAH 4,25 billion 
for other unemployment benefits.</p>
    <p>The Cabinet of Ministers introduced price regulation for the 
period of the quarantine for 10 socially important food products, 20 
categories of personal protective equipment and medicines and more than 
10 types of antiseptics. After the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers 
came into force, it is necessary to declare a price increase 30 days in 
advance if the price rises by 15 percent or more, 15 days in advance if 
it increases by 10-15 percent, and three days in advance if it increases
 by 5-10 percent. The declaration should be filed on the change in the 
retail prices of each individual type of product. The government agency 
in charge of enforcing this control—the State Food Safety and Consumer 
Protection Service—is yet to publish the respective report for Q2 2020 (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dpss.gov.ua/" target="_blank">https://dpss.gov.ua</a>) but there is almost no mentioning of price infringement over this period in media.</p>

<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>In order to support the economy during the quarantine, the 
National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) eased monetary policy by cutting the key 
policy rate by 200bps down to 6 percent starting from June 12th, 2020. 
Since end-February 2020, the key policy rate has been cut by 500bps. 
Simultaneously the NBU narrowed the corridor on the overnight standing 
facilities from 2 percent to 1 percent.</p>
    <p>The NBU has modified the operational design of monetary policy 
implementation to provide banks with more liquidity management 
flexibility: the frequency of liquidity tenders has been doubled (from 
bi-weekly to weekly), two-week certificates of deposit have become 
one-week certificates, and short-term refinancing loans (which 
previously had a maximum maturity of 14 days) are now issued for a 
period of up to three months. </p>
    <p>The NBU has modified the calculation of reserve requirements 
(effective April 11) so as to free up some more domestic currency 
liquidity. </p>
    <p>The introduction of additional capital buffers—including the 
capital conservation buffer and the systemic buffer—will be delayed. 
However, banks are suggested to refrain from distributing dividend until
 at least October 2020, ensuring that financial institutions have an 
additional margin of safety. Onsite inspections and stress testing of 
banks have been postponed. NBU has adopted a regulation that facilitates
 restructuring of loans to borrowers facing financial difficulties due 
to impact of the COVID-19. Penalties on clients not servicing loans 
during the period starting on March 1 and until 30 days after the 
quarantine finishes should not apply if there are reasonable grounds. 
Parliament adopted a law that prohibits the opening new bankruptcy cases
 against legal entities on creditors’ claims that were opened after 
February 1st 2020 90 days after the quarantine period ends. In credit 
risk classification, the loans that were serviced as of March 1, 2020 
and restructured as of November 2020, will not be considered to have 
indications of default (temporarily restructuring is not treated as a 
trigger to recognize such loans as NPLs). </p>
    <p>Starting July 25, loans, the terms of restructuring of which 
provide for payments with a periodicity lower than or in an amount less 
than the requirements of Credit Risk Regulation (No351), will not be 
excluded from the group credit risk assessment. For the continuity of 
credit support to the public sector, banks have the right not to take 
into account information on the implementation of the revenue side of 
the budget in 2020 when assessing credit risk on loans granted to public
 and local governments (debtors - budgetary institutions).</p>
    <p>Given the increased consumer lending and the current experience 
with an increase in NPLs during the Corona-crisis, in September the NBU 
repeatedly pre-announced plans to increase risks weights on consumer 
lending from 100 percent up to 150 percent starting in the second half 
of 2021. At the same time, the NBU is planning to simplify the rules for
 assessing the credit risk on specialized lending, allowing the 
assessment of clients on a group basis.</p>
    <p>Parliament has adopted legislation (effective starting late June)
 releasing borrowers from obligations to pay a penalty, fine, penalty 
for a delay in repaying the obligation under the contract to the lender 
(banks and NBFIs) in case the delay appeared during the quarantine 
period and/or 30 days after the date of its completion.</p>
    <p>Parliament has approved—and the has NBU operationalized—a 
decision to maintain the current minimum statutory capital of banks, and
 the NBU will adopt regulation abolishing the requirements for minimum 
statutory capital to increase from UAH 200 million up to UAH 300 million
 by end-2020 with further increase up to UAH 500 million by July 2024.</p>
    <p>The law on simplified procedures for banks’ restructuring and 
recapitalization was extended for 4 more years (until Aug 1, 2024).</p>
    <p>In order to alleviate compliance burdens on banks during the 
COVID-crisis, the NBU has extended by six months the deadlines for banks
 to submit their problem asset resolution plans (for assets that were 
performing as of March 1, 2020), with full implementation of the problem
 assets resolution postponed until November 30, 2020. The NBU has also 
extended the deadline for banks to submit their risk tolerance 
declarations by four months, as well as the business recovery plans for 
non-systemic banks by two and a half months (by December 20, 2020). 
Business recovery plans can be based on one (the most severe) 
stress-test only. Systemic banks were allowed to postpone the submission
 of their business recovery plans by two months (to December 1, 2020). 
Business recovery plans do not need to include a list of critical 
functions, the termination of which may threaten financial stability or 
may significantly negatively affect the economy. The NBU eliminated the 
tariffs for banks using its electronic payments system (SEP) and 
provided banks with guidance to ensure and promote their remote/cashless
 services.</p>
    <p>The NBU has postponed the deadlines for banks to publish their 
financial statements: annual 2019 audited statements can be published 5 
business days after the general shareholders meeting and 2020Q1 interim 
financial statements can be published by June 30 (both postponed from 
April 30); and 2020Q1 consolidated financial statements can be published
 by July 30 (postponed from May 30).</p>
    <p>In support of the banking sector, the NBU took the decision not 
to apply to banks and banking groups until June 2021 sanctions for 
violation of capital adequacy requirements, liquidity requirements, 
credit risk, as well as restrictions on transactions between the bank 
and investors related to the subordinated debt. Such a decision will be 
valid only if the violations arose due to the negative impact of the 
quarantine and restrictive measures on the bank or banking group, and 
provided that banks or banking groups do not violate capital adequacy 
ratios and liquidity ratios under Articles 75 and 76 of the Law "On 
banks and banking activities ". The decision does not apply to banks, 
which, despite the recommendations of the National Bank, distributed 
profits for 2019 through dividends.</p>
    <p>The NBU recommended to the Financial Services Regulator to 
transfer the regulation of insurance companies to the NBU starting July 1<sup>st</sup>.
 It also recommended to introduce measures to enable the remote and 
smooth work of the insurance companies that exempt insurance companies 
from the sanctions and fines in certain cases and prolong the deadline 
for submission of the 2019 financial statements.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In order to further support bank liquidity and lending, on April 23<sup>rd</sup>,
 the NBU announced the following measures: in late April the NBU 
extended the term of the refinancing loans that are granted through 
weekly tenders, from 30 to 90 days, and expanded its list of eligible 
collateral that banks can use to obtain financing using standard 
liquidity support instruments , incorporating municipal bonds and 
government-guaranteed corporate bonds into the pool of eligible 
collateral; the NBU also introduced an interest rate swap tool that 
banks can rely on to minimize interest rate risk, which is expected to 
become available in the second quarter; and auctions under long-term 
refinancing instrument (up to 5 years), the first auction took place on 
May 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>
    <p>The NBU approved the General Terms and Conditions for Interest 
Rate Swap Operations, as well as the underlying methodology for the fair
 value calculation and other elements necessary to operationalize the 
instrument. The instrument will be introduced in order to revive 
long-term bank lending. The first price auction took place on July 2, 
2020.</p>
    <p>In September, the NBU expanded the list of collateral eligible 
for ELA facility to also include property rights on credit agreements 
with legal entities denominated in FX, as well as property rights on 
credit agreements with legal entities of a lower class of borrowers 
(fifth class).</p>
    <p>Following the April expansion of the list of eligible collateral 
for refinancing loans and repo transactions, in September the NBU 
clarified the methodology for evaluating municipal bonds. In addition, 
the NBU revised the haircuts for domestic government bonds pledged as 
collateral under refinancing loans, direct repo, IRS and transactions on
 cash storage agreements.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The NBU and EBRD have agreed to set up and partially activated a 
US$500 million FX swap facility to support the real economy and 
strengthen Ukraine’s macrofinancial stability. </p>

<h3>United Arab Emirates</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The UAE economy is being affected by the
 spread of COVID-19 as well as the sharp decline in oil prices. The 
first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on January 29, 2020. The 
authorities have enacted several measures to limit the spread of the 
virus, including closure of schools, nurseries, shopping malls, parks, 
dine-in restaurants, and various tourist attractions. As part of their 
National Epidemic Control Plan, they have also imposed wide-ranging 
travel restrictions (including grounding of flights and halting visa 
issuance), suspended prayers at mosques and other large gatherings, and 
enacted teleworking arrangements in government offices. Alongside, the 
authorities have increased testing and scaled up disinfection efforts, 
established a dedicated task force to ensure uninterrupted supply of 
consumer goods and prevent manipulative pricing practices, and launched 
remote learning initiative to ensure continuity of education. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Starting April 24, the 
authorities have begun gradual reopening of shopping centers and other 
businesses, subject to social distancing requirements, and began 
facilitating repatriation of expatriate workers wishing to return to 
their home countries. Several airlines have resumed a limited number of 
regular passenger flights. Most government employees have returned to 
work as of mid-June. Dubai reopened to international tourists on July 7.
 Starting July 29, restaurants, coffee shops, cafes and other licensed 
food outlets in Abu Dhabi can now operate at 80 per cent capacity.</p>

<h3>United Kingdom</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>The first confirmed case was reported on
 January 31, 2020. Cases peaked in April/May. After weeks of decline, 
cases have risen again, reaching the levels seen during the initial 
peak, including several localized spikes. Deaths associated with 
COVID-19 have remained low, though.  In response to the outbreak, on 
March 23 the government implemented a range of measures including travel
 restrictions, social distancing measures, closures of entertainment, 
hospitality, non-essential shops and indoor premises, and increased 
testing. In the first quarter of 2020 the economy contracted by 2.2 
percent relative to the previous quarter, with a 6.9 percent 
month-on-month contraction in March. The economy contracted by 20.4 
percent q-o-q in the second quarter, reflecting a sharp contraction in 
April. Recovery started in May and accelerated though July, with about 
half the output loss recovered by then.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On May 10, the government 
set out a roadmap to ease the lockdown in England (Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland have separate rules). In the first step, May 13-31, 
people who could were requested to work from home, while those working 
in the manufacturing and construction sectors were encouraged to go back
 to work minimizing the use of public transportation. In step 2, 
starting on June 1, some schools as well as outdoor markets and car 
showrooms were allowed to reopen, while all other non-essential retail 
reopened on June 15. In step 3, starting on July 4, the hospitality and 
personal care industries, as well as public places, reopened while 
enforcing social distancing. Gradual opening steps continued since then.
 All educational facilities are opening in September. Face covering 
requirements are in effect since July 24. New guidance in effect as of 
September 14 restricts meetings to socialize with people outside the 
household to groups of up to 6. Additional guidance was published on 
September 22 entailing: the obligation to wear masks in taxis and 
hospitality and retail venues; restricting the number of people in 
social gatherings and support groups to 15; requesting people to work 
from home if they can; mandating venues in the hospitality and leisure 
sectors to close between 10 pm and 5 am. The government has published 
“COVID-19 Secure” guidelines for employers to help protect their 
workforce and customers from coronavirus that must be met as a condition
 for reopening. Due to increased cases, localized restrictions have been
 reinstated in certain areas.  </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Tax and spending measures to support households and families 
during the health emergency include: (i) additional funding for the NHS,
 public services and charities (£48.5 billion); (ii) measures to support
 businesses (£29 billion), including property tax holidays, direct 
grants for small firms and firms in the most-affected sectors, and 
compensation for sick pay leave; and (iii) strengthening the social 
safety net to support vulnerable people (by £8 billion) by increasing 
payments under the Universal Credit scheme as well as expanding other 
benefits.&nbsp;The government has launched three separate loans schemes 
to facilitate business’ access to credit. Together with the British 
Business Bank the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme to 
support SMEs and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loans 
Scheme to support bigger firms, which carry an 80 percent guarantee for 
loans up to £5 million for the former and up to £300 million for the 
latter. In addition, the government has put in place the Bounce Bank 
loan scheme for SMEs with 100 percent guarantee for loan amounts up to 
£50,000. It has also deferred VAT payments for the second quarter of 
2020 until the end of the financial year and income tax payments of the 
self-employed by six months. The government will pay 80 percent of the 
earnings of self-employed workers and furloughed employees (to a maximum
 of £2,500 per employee per month) initially for the period March-May. 
For furloughed employees, the scheme has been extended until 
end-October. Starting in July employers will be allowed to furlough 
employees for part of the daily working hours. Government coverage falls
 to 70 percent of wages in September (up to £2,187) and 60 percent in 
October (up to £1,875) with employers required to contribute the 
difference to 80 percent of wages (up to £2,500). The scheme for the 
self-employed has been extended for three more months but at a reduced 
level of 70 percent of earnings. Trade credit insurance for 
business-to-business transactions will receive up to £10 billion of 
government guarantees through the Trade Credit Reinsurance scheme, with 
the scheme available for nine months. The government has put in place a 
£1bn package to support firms driving innovation and development through
 grants and loans. To support the international response, the government
 has made available £150 million to the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/16/49/Catastrophe-Containment-and-Relief-Trust" target="_blank">IMF’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
 and provided a new £2.2 billion loan to the IMF Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Trust (PRGT) to help low income countries respond to COVID-19.</span> See also:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. </span></p>
    <p>The government adopted a package of measures to protect and 
create jobs and support the economic recovery. These include: providing 
firms £1,000 per furloughed employee retained until end-January; paying 
the minimum wage for 25 hours per week for six months for young workers 
at risk of long-term unemployment; increased resources to enhance skills
 and facilitate reinsertion in the job market; temporary reductions of 
the VAT rate for hospitality, accommodation and attractions and the real
 estate transactions tax; increased public spending on infrastructure 
(including on green projects such as retrofitting houses to improve 
energy efficiency); and a program to subsidize dining out during the 
month of August. Low-income people who need to self-isolate and are 
unable to work, as well as members of their household, will receive £130
 and £182, respectively. Businesses required to shut down due to 
localized lockdowns will receive up to £1,500 every three weeks.</p>

    Key measures include: (i) reducing Bank Rate by 65 basis points to 0.1
    percent; (ii) expanding the central bank’s holding of UK government bonds
    and non-financial corporate bonds by £300 billion; (iii) introducing a new
    Term Funding Scheme to reinforce the transmission of the rate cut, with
    additional incentives for lending to the real economy, and especially SMEs;

    the government’s overdraft account at the BoE to provide a short-term
    source of additional liquidity to the government if needed ;(v) launching
    the joint HM Treasury—Bank of England Covid Corporate Financing Facility
    which, together with the Coronavirus Business Interruption Schemes, makes
    £330bn of loans and guarantees available to businesses (15 percent of GDP);
    (vi) activating a Contingent Term Repo Facility to complement the Bank’s
    existing sterling liquidity facilities; (vii) together with central banks
    from Canada, Japan, Euro Area, U.S., and Switzerland, further enhancing the
    provision of liquidity via the standing US dollar liquidity swap line
    arrangements; and (viii) reducing the UK countercyclical buffer rate to 0
    percent from a pre-existing path toward 2 percent by December 2020, with
    guidance that it will remain at 0 for at least 12 months. See also:

    The Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) set out supervisory expectation
    that banks should suspend dividends and buybacks until end-2020, cancel
    outstanding 2019 dividends and pay no cash bonuses to senior staff. The PRA
    indicated all Pillar 2A requirements will be set as a nominal amount,
    instead of a percentage of total Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) and to
    mitigate the possibility of procyclical market risk capital requirements,
    the PRA will temporarily allow firms to offset the increase in
    risk-weighted assets due to the automatic application of a higher VaR
    multiplier through a commensurate reduction in risks-not-in-VAR (RNIV)
    capital requirements (See

    ). The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced a package of
    targeted temporary measures to support customers affected by coronavirus,
    including by setting the expectation for firms to offer a payment freeze on
    loans and credit cards for up to three months.
    </p>
    <p>A new package of measures was announced on September 24. The 
measures are the following: (i) a 6-month Job Support Scheme whereby 
employers will pay the wages of staff for the hours they work while for 
the hours not worked the government and the employer will each pay one 
third of their equivalent salary, up to £697.92 per month each. 
Employees must be working at least 33% of their usual hours; (ii) 
Extending the Self Employment Income Support Scheme for those continuing
 to actively trade but face reduced demand due to coronavirus, with the 
initial lump sum covering 20 percent of three months’ worth of profits 
for the period from November to the end of January next year up to a 
total of £1,875 (an additional second grant, will be available for the 
period from February 2021 to the end of April); (iii) extending the 
temporary 15% VAT cut (from 20 to 5%) for the tourism and hospitality

<h3>United States of America</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The US confirmed the first case of 
COVID-19 in January. Following a widening outbreak in March and April, 
the number of new cases declined after a range of containment measures 
were put in place. Infections rose again in early summer as economic 
activity and travelling resumed, but gradually declined over the summer 
following stricter prevention measures. However, new cases started to 
pick up again in September. Reflecting the impact of the containment 
measures, the U.S. economy contracted at an annualized rate of 31.7 
percent in the second quarter and the unemployment rate stayed at 8.4 
percent in August.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy</strong>. Due to heterogenous 
developments of the Covid-19 outbreak across states, progress on 
reopening the economy varied across the country. As of September, 
restaurants, gyms and/or house of worship remained closed in some states
 (e.g. California, Arizona), while retail stores and personal-care 
services have reopened across the country. Schools have reopened in most
 states with approaches (in-person instruction, virtual or hybrid) 
varied across states and regions.</p>

    Federal funds rate were lowered by 150bp in March to 0-0.25bp. Purchase of
    Treasury and agency securities in the amount as needed. Expanded overnight
    and term repos. Lowered cost of discount window lending. Reduced existing
    cost of swap lines with major central banks and extended the maturity of FX
    operations; broadened U.S. dollar swap lines to more central banks; offered
    temporary repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Federal Reserve also introduced facilities to support the flow of credit,
    in some cases backed by the Treasury using funds appropriated under the
    CARES Act. The facilities are: (i)    <em>Commercial Paper Funding Facility</em> to facilitate the issuance of
    commercial paper by companies and municipal issuers; (ii)    <em>Primary Dealer Credit Facility</em> to provide financing to the Fed’s
    24 primary dealers collateralized by a wide range of investment grade
    securities; (iii) <em>Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility</em>
    (MMLF) to provide loans to depository institutions to purchase assets from
    prime money market funds (covering highly rated asset backed commercial
    paper and municipal debt); (iv)    <em>Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility </em>to purchase new bonds and
    loans from companies; (v)    <em>Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility </em>to provide liquidity
    for outstanding corporate bonds; (vi)    <em>Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility </em>to enable the issuance
    of asset-backed securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit-card
    loans, loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, and certain
    other assets; (vii)    <em>Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF)</em> to provide
    liquidity to financial institutions that originate loans under the Small
    Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) which provides
    a direct incentive to small businesses to keep their workers on the
    payroll; (viii) <em>Main Street Lending Program</em> to purchase new or

    <p>Supervisory action. Federal banking supervisors encouraged depository
    institutions to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend, to work
    constructively with borrowers affected by COVID-19, and indicated COVID-19
    related loan modifications would not be classified as troubled debt
    restructurings. Holdings of U.S. Treasury Securities and deposits at the
    Federal Reserve Banks could be temporarily excluded from the calculation of
    the supplementary leverage ratio for holding companies. Other actions
    include offering regulatory reporting relief and adjusting supervisory
    approach to temporarily reduce scope and frequency of examinations and give
    additional time to resolve non-critical, existing supervisory findings.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Regulatory action. Lower the community bank leverage ratio to 8 percent.
    Provide extension transition for the Current Expected Credit Loss
    accounting standard. PPP covered loans will receive a zero percent risk
    weight, and assets acquired and subsequently pledged as collateral to the
    MMLF and PPPLF facilities will not lead to additional regulatory capital
    requirements. Allow early adoption of "the standardized approach for

<h3>Uruguay</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first cases of COVID-19 were 
reported on March 13. The government introduced a series of public 
health measures, such as school closures, cancellation of public events,
 and active discouragement of large gatherings. Starting April 22, 
customers must wear face masks while shopping in supermarkets; this rule
 is currently being expanded to other establishments. International 
travel has been severely restricted. After a sharp decline in mid-June, 
the number of new infections has increased somewhat, but remains well 
below its March-April peaks. Starting July 1, travelers from Uruguay 
were allowed entry into the European Union. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The Office of Planning and
 Budget—which reports to the President—is developing a roadmap for 
re-opening the economy in consultation with experts and private sector 
representatives. Some containment measures have already been relaxed: 
construction activity was allowed to restart in mid-April, government 
offices re-opened in early May, and shopping centers reopened on June 9,
 all with appropriate sanitary precautions. Bars and restaurants are 
reopening, and the soccer matches are expected to begin in August, 
without the spectators.  As of June 29, almost all schools (including in
 the capital Montevideo) have been re-opened. Starting August 3, school 
hours will be extended to be closer to normal hours.     </p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of August 26, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Additional resources to address the public health emergency have 
been mobilized, including by resorting to contingent credit lines from 
other international financial institutions. Furthermore, some tax and 
pension obligations are being postponed or reduced, utility payments are
 being cancelled or reduced for some companies, rules for claiming the 
unemployment insurance are being made more flexible (with the most 
recent extension of the unemployment insurance introduced in early 
August), older workers will be subsidized so they do not have to leave 
home, and assistance to the most vulnerable groups (cash and direct 
provision of food) will be expanded. Starting in June, the government 
subsidized employment by paying companies 5,000 pesos per month (about 
1/3 of the current minimum wage) for three months for each new hire. The
 cost of expanding the unemployment insurance, of assisting older 
workers, and of cash transfers is estimated at $400 million (0.7 percent
 of GDP), and the fiscal overall cost of the pandemic, including some 
additional measures and decline in tax revenues, is currently estimated 
to be roughly double that amount. As a solidarity measure, the salaries 
of better-paid public officials are being reduced by up to 20 percent, 
with the savings directed to the newly-established Coronavirus Fund. 
Other sources for the Coronavirus Fund include the additional Social 
Security Assistance Tax, the 2019 profits of Banco República and the 
National Development Corporation, and donations. Currently, this fund 
finances the cash subsidies and food assistance for the most vulnerable,
 together with the cash subsidies for the employees in the construction 
industry affected by the pandemic-related work stoppages.

<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The central bank has been focused on maintaining the appropriate 
level of liquidity in the system. It has temporarily reduced the reserve
 requirements that apply to the nominal peso and the inflation-adjusted 
peso deposits in the commercial banks. This measure has injected about 
US$150 million of additional liquidity into the financial system. </p>
    <p>The central bank has temporarily relaxed the regulations in the 
securities and payments markets and extended the deadlines for data 
submission.</p>
    <p>Loan payments for households and businesses that occur between 
March 1 and August 31, 2020 are to be deferred for up to 180 days. </p>
    <p>The fund that guarantees loans for SMEs will be expanded from 
US$50 million to US$500 million (utilizing financing from international 
organizations). That will allow to guarantee the SME loans totaling 
US$2.5 billion. In addition, the rate of commission charged by the fund 
will be reduced substantially.</p>
    <p>BROU (the country’s largest commercial bank, which is 
government-owned) will extend soft loans to enterprises. The financing 
available currently is US$50 million, which may be augmented—also with 
financing from international organizations—to US$120 million. In 
addition, direct credit program for micro and small enterprises will 
extend working capital loans of up to 18 months to the affected 
businesses at subsidized rates. Loan repayments for these enterprises 
are being suspended for at least 30 days.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Uzbekistan</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Uzbekistan reported its first confirmed 
case of COVID-19 on March 16, 2020. The authorities implemented 
extensive measures to prevent the spread of the virus including: 
restricting travel (including international flights, domestic public 
transportation, and movement by car), closing borders (except for 
trade), closing schools, universities, and all stores except grocery 
stores and pharmacies, and cancelling public events and religious 
gatherings. Government employees were asked to telework or to stay home.
 As a result, new cases peaked at about 750 per week in mid-April (out 
of a population of 34 million). New cases continued to decline to about 
300 new cases per week in mid-May.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy</strong>. In May some restrictions 
on individual and business activities were lifted. However, in July the 
number of new cases accelerated, particularly in the capital region 
(Tashkent). The government reimposed quarantine restrictions (including 
on travel between regions, public events, and large non-food markets, 
stores, and restaurants). In early August, the number of new cases 
reached a second peak of about 6,000 new cases per week, before 
subsiding again.</p>
<p><strong>Economic impact</strong>. As elsewhere, the global pandemic 
has significantly impacted Uzbekistan’s economy. Uzbekistan has faced 
weaker trading partner demand (particularly for natural gas) and lower 
domestic demand due to quarantine restrictions and uncertainty leading 
to lower private consumption and investment. These effects have been 
partly offset by the increase in gold prices (Uzbekistan’s largest 
export) and a recovery in remittances. In the first half of 2020, 
Uzbekistan’s real GDP growth was 0.2 percent, compared with 4.1 percent 
in the first quarter. Uzbekistan’s exchange rate was relatively steady 
in the first quarter. As COVID crisis spread to global markets, the 
exchange rate depreciated 5½ percent in April, and has remained 
relatively stable since.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 8, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>To deal with the crisis, Uzbekistan’s government created an 
Anti-Crisis Fund of US$ 1 billion (about 2 percent of GDP) to support 
the economy and help those most affected by the crisis.  In addition to 
the Anti-Crisis Fund, the government temporary reduced some taxes and 
the Fund for Reconstruction and Development increased lending. Specific 
crisis response measures have included: (i) expanded funding for 
healthcare, including for medicines, the costs of quarantines, and 
salary supplements for healthcare works; (ii) an increase in the number 
of families with children and low-income families receiving social 
benefits; (iii) assistance to affected businesses via interest 
subsidies; and (iv) additional public works for infrastructure and to 
support employment. The authorities also temporary reduced social 
contributions for individual entrepreneurs, postponed the payment of 
property and land taxes, extended a moratorium on tax audits, and 
delayed tax declarations for 2019 income taxes. The central government 
also asked local governments to reduce taxes by 30 percent and provide a
 6-month grace period on paying property tax.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The central bank suggested banks defer loan payments for firms in
 sectors affected by COVID-19. Consequently, state-owned banks have 
extended deadlines for loan repayments for affected sectors, including 
for the national air carrier. The central bank reduced its policy rate 
by 200 basis points in 2020. The policy rate was reduced from 16 to 15 
percent in April 15, and from 15 to 14 percent in September 8. While the
 central bank has not changed requirements for regulatory capital or 
liquidity, it continues monitoring financial conditions.</p>

<h3>Vanuatu</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> There are no confirmed cases or deaths 
from COVID-19 as of September 10, 2020. The government’s response is 
being coordinated by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), the
 National Disaster Committee, and the COVID-19 advisory committee of 14 
Directors from various government ministries. A national State of 
Emergency (SOE) was declared on March 26 for a two-week period. The SOE 
was extended for a 30-day period on April 11 as a prevention and 
containment measure for COVID-19 and in response to Tropical Cyclone 
(TC) Harold which impacted Vanuatu on April 6-7. After further renewals,
 it is now due to expire on December 31, 2020. The government: closed 
all ports of entry for international flights and cruise ships; suspended
 all domestic flights and ferries; temporarily suspended departures for 
seasonal worker programs to Australia and New Zealand (with optional 
repatriation of workers already abroad); closed all schools; established
 curfews for businesses and transport (excludes essential medical and 
communication services); banned gatherings of more than 5 people 
(suspended temporarily as of April 5 to allow for group sheltering 
caused by TC Harold and its aftermath) and been encouraging social 
distancing. Tourism, which contributes 24.6 percent of Vanuatu’s GDP, 
has effectively ceased.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Domestic flights and 
ferries resumed on April 11, also in response to the aftermath of TC 
Harold. From May 12, international flights and vessels carrying 
international relief supplies or cargo can enter, provided they comply 
with Vanuatu’s COVID-19 prevention and containment measures. All public 
schools reopened on May 18. The government is drafting a plan to address
 the reopening and recovery of the tourism sector which involves how to 
get visitors back to Vanuatu and under what conditions. From June 3, the
 government began repatriation of its citizens and residents stranded 
abroad after strengthening in-country COVID-19 screening, testing and 
containment measures. Repatriation and return of vessels registered 
locally or internationally as Vanuatu vessels outside Vanuatu waters 
were suspended from July 11 till July 31. The second phase of 
government’s repatriation plan has resumed in August and is expected to 
continue until December 2020. The government confirmed on September 18 
that targeted testing in quarantine for COVID-19 is being conducted as 
an additional precaution for those entering Vanuatu from areas 
classified as high risk. The government announced on July 16 that it 
wants to create a travel bubble – the Tamtam travel bubble – although it
 may not do so until 2021. On September 3, Vanuatu began a trial 
Seasonal Workers Program with Australia, called the Mango Pilot project,
 providing employment for 162 ni-Vanuatu (as mango pickers) in Northern 
Territory.</p>

    <p>The government, using its existing budget envelope and with help 
from Australia, China, New Zealand, UNICEF, WHO, other NGOs/CSOs and 
some local businesses, is: expanding health facilities, restocking 
personal protective equipment and supplies, and further training 
healthcare workers, especially in Port Vila; and spending on community 
education and awareness. With the assistance of Australia, France and 
New Zealand, COVID-19 tests are analyzed in the French special 
collectivity of New Caledonia as needed. The government provided flights
 and covered arrival and short-term quarantine costs in Port Vila for 
repatriated ni-Vanuatu. The Vanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF) 
provided Hardship Loans, an interest-free withdrawal from a member’s 
account for 6 months of up to 100,000 vatu, after which the member 
either choses a repayment plan with interest or permanently withdraws 
the funds with a penalty. When the loan facility closed on May 1, the 
VNPF had paid out about 1.5 billion vatu (US$12.5 million). On March 31,
 a first-stage fiscal package worth 4.4 billion vatu (roughly 4.5 
percent of GDP) was announced. It includes: deferred and cancelled 
taxes, license fees and charges for businesses in 2020 (796 million 
vatu); backdating to start of 2020 some reductions resulting from 
forthcoming business license reforms; the Employment Stabilization 
Payment (ESP) (reimbursing employers 30,000 vatu per employee per month 
for four months, plus an additional 12 percent to the employer, for a 
total of 2.5 billion vatu); SMEs (turnover of less than 200 million 
vatu) will also receive the value of their business license fees 
(roughly 400 million vatu); Commodity Support Grant will be provided to 
producers of copra, kava, cocoa and coffee (300 million vatu); Shipping 
Support Grant to facilitate farmers’ access to major market centres such
 as Port Vila and Luganville (100 million vatu); secondary school 
tuition fees are suspended for 2020 (42,000 vatu per student for a total
 of 510 million vatu, paid directly to schools). The package is financed
 by the government’s cash reserves, reprioritization of expenditures, 
some debt, and development partner assistance. The government announced 
on September 9, that the ESP will end on September 15.</p>

meetings, that along with its policy rate cut, were consistent with its 
twin policy objectives to maintain inflation within a target range of 
0-4 percent and official foreign exchange reserves above a minimum 
threshold of 4 months of import cover. Other RBV measures include: a 
reduction of commercial banks’ Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) from 12.0 
per cent to 10.0 per cent; and the reactivation of the Bank’s Imports 
Substitution and Export Finance Facility (ISEFF) and the Disaster

<h3>Vietnam</h3>
<p><strong>Background. </strong>Since the first case is reported on 
January 23, Vietnam has more than one thousand infected cases and about 
21,000 people are currently quarantined in centralized facilities or in 
self-isolation.  Social isolation measures introduced to combat local 
outbreaks in Da Nang and Hai Duong province have mostly been lifted. 
Vietnam has not had new domestic transmission cases in the last 21 days.
  Mobile apps are available (installed by around 60 percent of 
population) to provide alerts on positive cases and potential exposures 
in big cities.  Bluezone app, a newly developed app on contact tracing 
has been downloaded by 20 million people (20 percent of population) in 4
 weeks. GDP growth hit the lowest level in last two decades in H1, 2020 
(1.8 percent y/y), mainly reflecting substantial slowdown in 
manufacturing, and a contraction in the service sector, in particular 
transport, tourism and hospitality industries.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> While the nationwide 
lockdown was lifted on April 23 and social distancing rules have been 
eased, a recent local outbreak in Da Nang and Hoi An led to the 
re-introduction of social isolation measures on July 28 in these areas 
and few other local provinces later on. So far, limited contagion 
outside of Da Nang was reported.  Domestic travel to/from Da Nang and 
Hai Duong province and few other local cities after being curtailed for 5
 weeks have resumed since September 5.  All targeted social isolation 
areas have been removed since September 5, with restrictions standing 
for bar, dancing clubs and karaoke services.. A new guideline on 
epidemic protection has just been issued for normalization of people 
life.  International travel continues to be banned. In the meantime, the
 authorities have allowed  limited international travels for some 
selected regional destination since September 19, while applying less 
restrictive  14 day quarantine requirement for short stay visitors. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The government introduced a fiscal support package valued VND 284
 trillion (3.6 percent of GDP) to support the economy.  Measures include
 deferring payment of VAT and CIT tax obligations and land rental fees 
by 5 months, deferring PIT payment to year-end based on Decree 41/CP 
(the estimated amount of payments deferred is VND 180 trillion, or 2.4 
percent of GDP ). More than 37 percent  (VND 66 trillion) of total tax 
and land rental deferral package has been disbursed as of August 31. 
Newly approved measures include cutting registration tax by 50 percent 
and deferring excise tax on domestically produced cars, lowering land 
rental by 15 percent, deducting 30 percent of current environmental 
protection tax on jet-fuel from  August to December 2020, cutting or 
exempting various fees and charges, cutting CIT rate for small and micro
 firms by 30 percent, and raising PIT deduction ahead of the plan.  </p>
    <p>Other implemented measures include: tax exemptions for medical 
equipment; lower business registration fee effective from February 25 
(one-year exemption of business registration tax for newly established 
household business; first 3-year exemption of business registration tax 
for SMEs); streamlined tax and custom audit and inspection at firms; and
 allowing firms and workers to defer (up to 12 months) contributions to 
the pension fund and survivorship fund without interest penalty (total 
delayed contribution is estimated at VND 9.5 trillion or 0.1 percent of 
GDP). Based on Resolution 42/CP, the government also approved a cash 
transfer package worth VND 36 trillion (0.5 percent of GDP) for affected
 workers and households with monthly cash transfers provided for no more
 than 3 months, from April to June. More than 10 percent of the 
population is estimated to benefit from this program. The Ministry of 
Finance estimated that approximately VND 12.8 trillion (36percent of 
total package value) has  been disbursed as of August 31 to the 
beneficiaries under this Resolution. Duration extension of the cash 
transfer program has been considered. </p>
    <p>The government is also targeting a 100 percent disbursement of 
public investment capital valued VND 686 trillion or nearly 9 percent of
 GDP (of which VND 225 trillion is carried over from previous years). 
Despite government’s efforts, disbursement of public investment still 
remained slow, meeting merely 47 percent of the budget plan in the first
 8 months.</p>

    Effective May 13, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) cut its benchmark 
policy rates by 50 bps, the second time in the year, after the first cut
 by 50-100 bps in March 17. The short-term deposit rates cap was cut 
further by 30-50 bps, while the short- term lending rate cap for 
priority sectors is trimmed further by 50 bps.</p>
    <p>The SBV has also issued guidelines to commercial banks to 
reschedule loans, reduce/exempt interest, and provide loan forbearance. 
As of mid- Sep , banks have registered a credit package totaling VND 300
 trillion (about 3.8 percent of GDP) at lower interest rates, and 
supported nearly 1.1 million customers( with outstanding loans of about 
 VND 2,300 trillion), by rescheduling repayment, exempting, and reducing
 interest on existing debts, and extending new loans. Recently the SBV 
also asked Credit Institutions to not only channel credit to 5 priority 
economic sectors, but also to accelerate consumer loans to meet 
legitimate demand of individuals and households. The SBV has delayed the
 phased reduction of the ratio of short-term funding to finance long 
term loans for one year, to help credit institutions reduce their cost 
of funding and maintain medium and long term loan outstanding. Financial
 institutions are also exempting and reducing fees. Several securities 
service fees cut and exemption have been extended through June 30, 2021.</p>
    <p>Affected firms are eligible to concessional loans from Vietnam 
Social Policy Bank (VSPB) with no interest for making salary payment to 
their workers who temporarily stopped working. The total loan value is 
planned at VND 16.2 trillion (around 0.2 percent of GDP). </p>
    <p>Effective March 31, SBV instructed Credit Institutions (CIs) to 
actively reduce bonus and salary, cut other operating costs, adjust 
business plans in a timely manner (including not paying dividend in 
cash), and use the saved resources to reduce interest. The SBV stated 
that it is ready to inject liquidity, including through refinancing 
windows, for VSPB and other CIs to implement the government’s programs 
and help CIs address NPLs.  The SBV has issued a circular on refinancing
 the VSPB up to VND 16 trillion at zero percent interest rate. </p>

<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>

    <p>With depreciation pressures rising, the SBV announced on Mar. 23 
that it would intervene in the currency market as needed to smooth 
excessive exchange rate volatility.  </p>

<h3>West Bank and Gaza</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The first confirmed COVID-19 case was 
reported on March 5, 2020 (WHO). During the early stages, the 
authorities implemented several measures to limit the spread of the 
virus including: restricting movement of all residents from homes; 
closing public places, including schools, universities, tourist 
attractions, coffee shops, and stores except for drug stores, bakeries, 
and supermarkets; limiting bank services and hours of operation; 
restricting travel within West Bank (among governorates and villages); 
limiting employee attendance at government and private workplaces 
(except for critical staff); and imposing mandatory quarantines for 
those returning from abroad. On April 2 President Abbas issued a decree 
extending the state of emergency, initially issued on March 5, for 
another 30 days. On June 3, President Abbas issued a decree extending 
the state of emergency until July 4, 2020. </p>
<p>A second wave of coronavirus spread has been hitting WBG since June 
22 with several hundred cases reported in a few days. PM Shtayeh 
reinstated a five-day lockdown of Hebron Governorate, and a two-day 
closure of Nablus. Only pharmacies, bakery shops, and factories would be
 allowed to operate. In addition, he declared an immediate ban in all 
forms of public gatherings in all West Bank governorates. Work in 
Israeli settlements would be forbidden. On July 1, the authorities 
announced a five-day closure in all governorates from July 3 to July8 
which was subsequently renewed for five more days. All institutions, 
movement and traffic would be halted, both within and across all 
governorates. Only pharmacists, bakeries and supermarkets would be 
allowed to operate during the five-day period. On July 12, the 
authorities announced a prohibition of all movement between districts 
for another two weeks. Total closure will be extended on Hebron, 
Bethlehem, Ramallah and Nablus Districts for another four days for a 
total of 14 days. Movement between the hours of 8pm-6am will be 
prohibited in all districts for two weeks. On August 4, President Abbas 
issued a presidential decree extending the state of emergency for 30 
days. On August 28, President Abbas instructed the Coronavirus Emergency
 Committee to send a ministerial delegation to the Gaza Strip to follow 
up on the situation there and provide needed assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> On April 20, PM Mohammad 
Shtayyeh announced several measures to ease economic restrictions 
depending on prevailing conditions in individual governorates. Small 
businesses with 3 workers or less will be allowed to operate between 
10am-5pm; clothes and shoes stores will open twice a week; taxis will 
operate subject to passenger restrictions; pharmaceutical factories will
 operate at 50 percent capacity; and sweets shops can resume delivery 
services. On May 5, PM Shtayyeh announced a partial ease of the lockdown
 and gradual and phased exit from COVID-19. The public would be allowed 
to go around during daytime, but not at nighttime. Construction sites 
will reopen in all governorates. Hair salons will reopen in all 
governorates on Saturdays and Sundays (two customers by prior 
reservation) except in governorates infected with COVID-19. Clothing, 
footwear and home appliance stores will reopen throughout the week 
except in governorates infected with the virus where they will open for 
three days. Banks will open except in infected areas where they will 
continue to operate according to emergency procedures. Public transport 
will return in non-infected governorates, and private transportation 
among non-infected governorates will also resume. Wearing masks, gloves 
and social distancing will be mandatory.</p>
<p>On July 28, the PA government announced the temporary easing of 
lockdown measures ahead of Eid al Adha reverting to a full lockdown 
after the holiday. On August 5, the PA government eased restrictions and
 allowed cafes, restaurants, gyms to reopen at 50 percent capacity. It 
tightened monitoring of public places, imposing penalties on violators. 
The government also formed a daily follow-up committee comprising of all
 ministries and security agencies to conduct field inspection and 
oversight operations through special committees. The government decided 
to maintain the ban on events, including weddings and condolence 
gatherings, and the closure of events halls. </p>

<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 23, 2020</h6>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Palestinian Authority (PA) is planning to spend NIS 410 
million (0.7 percent of GDP) to cover short-term (1-3 months) critical 
gaps related to COVID-19. Among other things, the PA is recruiting 51 
doctors, medical specialists and general practitioners and plans to 
purchase of testing toolkits, quarantine facilities, respirators, masks,
 medicines, and disinfectants. In addition, it plans to allocate 
additional resources to support poor families and those in need. The 
authorities plan to spend NIS 20 million (0.1 percent of GDP) to support
 workers and for unemployment benefits. On the tax side, the PA is 
cancelling penalties for late submission of tax returns, extending the 
tax filing deadline to June, and the period of quittance issued by the 
value added tax from March 1 to April 15, 2020.</p>
    <p>On May 5, PM Shtayyeh said that following an earlier 
understanding with a Palestinian labor union, private sector employees 
have been paid half of their salaries by their employers. The government
 also distributed some 98,000 food baskets and paid financial assistance
 to about 125,000 households.</p>
    <p>The government started on May 17 the disbursement of aid to 
40,202 laborers affected by the Corona pandemic. Laborers in eligible 
sectors (e.g., construction, tourism, services, transport) would receive
 text messages to go to the bank and receive NIS 700. The process would 
take place over five days.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Palestine Monetary Authority has postponed monthly/periodic 
loan repayments to all borrowers for the next four months, and for the 
tourism and hotel sectors for the next six months. It has also 
prohibited the collection of fees, commissions or additional interest on
 deferred payments. These measures are subject to extension.</p>
    <p>On July 21, the PMA issued new instructions to banks to mitigate 
the economic effects of COVID-19. The new instructions apply to 
borrowers which banks consider to have been directly affected by the 
crisis. The new instructions give borrowers the possibility to postpone 
the payment of their obligations with multiple options (e.g., overdraft,
 restructuring, rescheduling, a temporary Tawarruq ceiling for Islamic 
banks). The PMA also lowered the liquidity requirement by 1 percent 
which frees up about USD 100 million of liquidity that banks could pump 
to the market . </p>
    <p>The PMA launched an SME fund to provide soft loans to SMEs 
impacted by the crisis. Loans are to be disbursed under the 3% interest 
rate and a repayment period of 36 months. The size of the SME fund will 
be USD 300 million of which USD 210 comes from banks’ reserves at the 
PMA.</p>
    <p>On 25 August, the PMA announced that $32m in credit facilities 
had been extended to SMEs affected by the COVID-19 pandemic through the 
‘Estidama’ (sustainability) program. </p>

<h3>Yemen</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Yemeni authorities reported the first 
confirmed case of COVID-19 on April 10, 2020 in areas under its control.
 The de facto administration has reported only a few cases in Sana’a. 
The UN expressed concerns on large undetected spreading of the disease 
in Yemen. The ongoing spread of COVID-19 could be devastating for Yemen 
as the possibility of rapid spread of the virus will be confronted with a
 poor health system that has already collapsed. After five years of 
conflict, the country is facing a humanitarian crisis already, with 
severely damaged health and general infrastructure. UN estimates that 
only half of the health centers in Yemen are fully functional, and there
 are limited testing facilities in a collapsed health system. The cease 
fire initiated by the Saudi-led coalition government since April 9, has 
ended, with some signs of conflict escalation with the Houthi rebels, 
but some de-escalation inside the coalition. The UN response to the 
COVID-19 crisis is hampered by the conflict. Shops and restaurants in 
Aden were closed following the news of the first outbreak in Aden, but 
quickly reopened on fears of food shortages.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Yemen started to see the 
number of COVID-19 cases to increase significantly in the past few weeks
 with a growing number of governorates reporting new cases. The 
government efforts and measures are still focus on the containment 
phase, in the context of the conflict. Some governorates started lifting
 the curfew but precautionary measures remain in place.  </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Government created a commission to deal with COVID-19 issues at 
the start of the crisis.  Ministry of Health has provided medical 
equipment to quarantine centers in some governorates. The ministry of 
Health has received some respirators and medical safety tools from the 
World Bank, through the World Health Organization. The government has 
allocated some limited budget resources to respond to the COVID-19 
crisis.</p>

million to fight the spread of the coronavirus. The United States 
announced it will provide $225 million in emergency aid through the UN 
World Food Program. Humanitarian programs are largely underfunded.</p>

<h3>Zambia</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Zambia recorded its first COVID-19 cases
 on March 18 and the number of daily cases is on a downward trajectory 
since August. Early actions to contain the spread of the virus included:
 (i) the closures of schools and universities; (ii) suspension of 
non-essential foreign travel; (iii) mandatory quarantine for all foreign
 travelers; (iv) closure of bars, cinemas, and casinos; (v) delivery and
 take-out regime for restaurants; (vi) restrictions of public gatherings
 to at most 50 people; (vii) restrictions on sports activities; (viii) a
 temporary lockdown of the towns of Kafue and Nakonde, and (ix) a 
partial closure of the border with Tanzania. In addition, the Zambian 
economy will be adversely impacted by the large decline in copper 
prices, sharp depreciation of the local currency, increase in yields on 
public debt, and economic disruptions due to lockdowns in trading 
partners. </p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> Since April 24, the 
government has been slowly lifting lockdowns, border closures, and 
restrictions, subject to social distancing, including on churches, some 
non-contact sports, and barber shops and salons. On May 8, cinemas, 
gyms, casinos, tourist spots, and restaurants were allowed to open as 
long as they adhere to strict social distancing and sanitary guidelines;
 bars and nightclubs were announced to reopen on September 12.  Primary 
and secondary school examination classes reopened on June 1; on 
September 14 all schools, colleges, and universities were reopened. A 
reopening of international airports was announced on June 25. </p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>
<br>
<h5>Fiscal</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Import duties on mineral concentrate and export duties on 
precious metals were suspended to support the mining sector. The 
government has waived tax penalties and fees on outstanding tax 
liabilities resulting from CoVID-19. It has suspended customs duties and
 VAT on some medical supplies and medical related commodities. It has 
also removed provisions related to claiming VAT on imported spare parts,
 lubricants, and stationery, in order to ease pressure on companies. The
 government has also issued an 8 billion kwacha bond (2.4 percent of 
GDP) to finance CoVID-19 related expenses, including health spending, 
arrears clearance, and grain purchases, as well as a recapitalization of
 the development bank (NATSAVE).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The Bank of Zambia’s Monetary Policy Committee lowered the policy
 rate by 225 bps to 9.25 percent on May 19and by 125 bps on August 19 to
 mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic. The BoZ plans to provide 
10 billion kwacha (3.1 percent of GDP) of medium-term liquidity support 
to eligible financial services providers, and also scale up open-market 
operations to provide short-term liquidity support to commercial banks. 
In addition, BoZ implemented several measures to stimulate the use of 
e-money and reduce the use of cash, revised the rules governing the 
operations of the interbank foreign exchange market to support its 
smooth functioning by strengthening market discipline and providing a 
mechanism to address heightened volatility, revised loan classification 
and provisioning rules, and extended the transitional arrangement to 
IFRS9. The BoZ has allowed financial service providers to renegotiate 
the terms of credit facilities with borrowers affected by the pandemic. 
Non-bank financial institutions were allowed to use capital instruments 
that do not qualify as common equity Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital for the 
purposes of computing regulatory capital. The Bank of Zambia initiated 
arrangements to engage domestic and non-resident financial institutions 
in foreign exchange swaps; and extended the requirement of mining 
companies to pay all their statutory obligations in US dollars.</p>

<h3>Zimbabwe</h3>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> Zimbabwe is facing three shocks: the 
COVID-19 pandemic, climatic-related drought and macro-economic policy. 
Most sectors of the economy have been affected by the COVID – 19 
pandemic, especially tourism, non-food manufacturing, mining, financial 
services, transport and agriculture. About 7.7 million (approximately 
half of the population) need food assistance, and at least 1.7 million 
require additional social protection. The first confirmed case of 
COVID-19 was recorded on March 20.  A Covid-19 National Preparedness and
 Response Plan was launched on March 19, 2020 with President Mnangagwa 
declaring the pandemic a State of National Disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening of the economy.</strong> The authorities have fully
 opened the economy with international flights set to resume on October 
1, 2020, and all sectors, including the tourism sector now functional. 
Schools will be opened on a phased basis with reopening for all schools 
to be completed by end-October 2020. </p>
<p>The authorities launched on April 2, 2020 a US$2.2 billion domestic 
and international humanitarian appeal covering the period April 2020 to 
April 2021. Of this, US$220 million, now revised to US$300 million is 
targeted at fighting COVID-19, US$37 million for other critical health 
spending, and US$34 million for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). 
Other critical needs include US$956 million for food insecurity, and 
US$20,8 million for social protection. As at July 2020, humanitarian 
support disbursements were US$26.9 million against US$202.6 pledges.</p>
<br>
<h6>Key Policy Responses as of September 24, 2020</h6>

quarantine centers.</p>
    <p>A cash transfer program that targeting 1 million vulnerable 
households is under implementation On May 4, 2020, the authorities 
announced a larger COVID-19 economic recovery and stimulus package 
including measures to: (i) provide liquidity support to several sectors,
 including agriculture (ZWL$6 billion), mining (ZWL$1 billion), tourism 
(ZWL$0.5 billion), SMEs (ZWL$0.5 billion), and arts (ZWL$0.02 billion); 
(ii) expand social safety nets and food grants (ZWL$3.9 billion); (iii) 
set up a health sector support fund (ZWL$1 billion); and (iv) 
&nbsp;upscale investments in social and economic infrastructure in 
Cyclone Idai affected communities (ZWL$18 billion).</p>
    <p>In addition, the freeze on government hiring has been lifted for 
the health sector, targeting over 4 713 additional medical personnel 
(about 20 percent increase); companies have been allowed to extend the 
payment of corporate taxes (waiving interest and penalties); and duties 
and taxes on various goods and services related to COVID-19 have been 
suspended, including on testing, protection, sterilization, and other 
medical consumables and procurement regulations have been relaxed to 
facilitate speedy procurement of essential goods and services. The 
authorities are also offering corporate tax credits of up to 50 percent 
for COVID-19 donations.</p>
    <p>With an inflation rate of 785.5 percent y-o-y in May 2020, the 
authorities increased all civil servants salaries and pensions by 50 
percent and also announced that in June they would start paying US$75 to
 civil servants and US$30 to pensioners to cushion them from the 
COVID-19 pandemic effects and the challenging economic situation. This 
is an interim arrangement and will be implemented from June to August 
2020.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Monetary and macro-financial</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>On March 26, 2020, the authorities returned the multicurrency 
system allowing both Zimbabwean dollar and US dollar to be legal tender.
 They reduced the statutory reserve ratio on bank deposits from 5 
percent to 4.5 percent. The statutory reserve ratio on bank deposits was
 further reduced from 4.5 percent to 2.5 percent in June 2020. They 
reduced bank policy rate from 35 percent to 15 percent per annum but 
have since July 1, 2020 reverted back to 35 percent in an effort to curb
 mounting pressures in the foreign exchange market. The central bank 
introduced a ZW$5 billion medium-term bank accommodation lending 
facility at 10 percent per annum and also increased private sector 
lending facility by the central bank from ZW$1 billion to ZW$2.5 
billion.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Exchange rate and balance of payments</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>In March 2020, the central bank moved from managed floating 
exchange rate system to a fixed exchange rate management system. The 
bank also revised the FX allocation priority list to improve allocation 
efficiency in light of the prioritize COVID-19 pandemic. Faced with 
acute foreign currency shortages, in June 2020 the authorities 
introduced a foreign currency auction system and reinstated the 30-day 
limit of liquidating surplus foreign exchange receipts from exports 
which was further revised to a 60-day limit for FX liquidation.</p>
